Intro Background

As our cloud footprint grows, so does the urgency to align on a platform strategy that enables speed, consistency and sustainable decision making. Just like we optimize the customer experience across our digital products, we now face the opportunity, and the responsibility, to do the same for our internal developer platform.

Today, that experience is fragmented. Platform capabilities such as pipelines, infrastructure provisioning, observability and cost visibility may exist but they're often disjointed, inconsistently applied or difficult to navigate. Engineers face friction in getting what they need which leads to

* Long provisioning timelines  
* Confusion around preferred patterns and standards  
* Manual, ticket-driven workflows  
* Missed opportunities to automate and reuse proven components

As an e-commerce business, we understand the value of designing seamless user experiences. We measure and optimize every step of the customer journey, from product discovery to checkout, because we know friction impacts outcomes. The developer experience deserves the same level of intention. Engineers are our internal customers and their experience navigating the platform should be just as curated, efficient and data informed.

Recently, third party frameworks ~~like Humanitec's~~ reference architecture have gained attention as potential solutions. These models offer valuable structure and language for platform engineering conversations. But they don't remove the need for us to make difficult internal decisions around ownership, priorities, trade-offs and a long term direction. A third-party reference can guide our thinking but it can't define our strategy.

This paper outlines an approach that centers the experience, reflects our unique challenges and proposes a practical, iterative path forward.

In the **Problem Description**, the paper lays out the details of the problem the paper addresses. When composing this important section, these are some considerations:

*   
  * If the problem you are describing is complex, consider creating multiple sub-sections for each aspect of the problem. (See the Rand Corporation’s white paper “Living Well at the End of Life” for a good example of this approach: [https://www.rand.org/pubs/white\_papers/WP137.html](https://www.rand.org/pubs/white_papers/WP137.html))  
  * Any problem has at least three elements: a core problem (the situation you want to change), a cause (one or more things that create the problem), and an impact (the harmful consequences of the problem). Consider signposting each of these elements of the problem as you discuss them. Our quickguide on Problem Proposals has a section focused on problem descriptions: [https://writingcenter.gmu.edu/writing-resources/different-genres/problem-proposals](https://writingcenter.gmu.edu/writing-resources/different-genres/problem-proposals).  
  * Provide evidence for the information you use to establish the problem, its causes, and its impact.  
  * The way you characterize the cause of the problem will have an effect on the solutions you present. A plan of action that does not address the cause of the problem will not be seen as logical solution. Make sure your problem description leads logically to the solutions you describe.

**Fragmented Experience Coupled with Cognitive load**

Today's platform experience is not unified. To developers, it often feels like a maze of disconnected systems, inconsistent workflows and unclear ownership. We have many tickets, many teams and many docs but we lack a single experience.

Engineers spend significant effort to piecing together what to do. While the engineering persona is independent by nature and wants to self serve through processes, the system today makes that hard.

*"i'd rather figure it out on my own than bug someone but the workflow didn't help me do that"* \- an engineer who just wants to move fast

Since the early 2000s, the number of tools, decisions and responsibilities engineers must manage has grown dramatically. According to \[research\] the DevOps toolchain sprawl has become unmanageable in many orgs. Engineers are expected to

* Understand and operate across 10+ systems  
* Navigate inconsistent documentation and workflows  
* Troubleshoot gaps independently

This is not sustainable. High-performing teams reduce this load by standardizing workflows and abstracting away low-value complexity. Our platform should do the same.

~~We obsess over the customer journey as a leading ecommerce retailer. From homepage to cart to checkout, the experience is seamless. And despite pieces being owned by many distinct teams, our customers never feel that. Our engineers deserve the same. But~~ today, working on our platform means understanding which team owns which piece, from observability, DNS, messaging, Databases, deployments to containers and secrets. We need to flip that. The platform should function as a product, with discoverable, connected workflows, consistent guidance and clearly defined golden paths. Our engineering systems should be cohesive by default, not stitched together by effort.

While the platform has grown in parts, it has done so without a unifying vision and has not matured as one system. As a result, the developer experience remains fragmented and the full value of the platform investment goes underutilized. To mature the experience, we must mature the platform itself, not in isolated verticals but in coordination. This doesn't mean slowing down individual efforts. It means connecting them. ~~The absence of a central, cohesive strategy for how the platform fits together is holding us back. The platform can evolve in a meaningful way when we treated it as an integrated product with common experience expectations.~~

**A Growing need for cost aware decision making** 

In addition to the friction in usability and the lack of a cohesive experience, cost visibility is another area where our platform experience falls short. While we do have some insight into cloud spend, there remains a broader disconnect between decisions and their financial impact. This is not a unique challenge, many organizations face it during their cloud journy, but it is one we must address now. As our platform matures, we should be integrating cost visibility into day to day engineering workflows, versus allowing it to surprise us. By doing so, we can start to shift toward a culture where cost becomes an input to planning, enabling teams to make smarter tradeoffs and leverage one of the core advantages of the cloud; cost as a lever for optimization not a limitation on delivery.

If the paper includes a **Criteria for Acceptable Solutions **section, list the criteria that any solid solution should meet. For example, a white paper seeking solutions to a parking shortage in a city might say that any solution should not encourage commuters or visitors to drive to their destination in the city. This criterion would make it unnecessary to discuss solutions that added parking capacity.

**Criteria for Acceptable Solutions**

In evaluating potential solutions to improve the platform experience, we must ground our approach in a clear set of non-negotiable criteria. These criteria reflect both what we've learned internally and what industry research shows about the attributes of high-performing engineering organizations. They are intended to filter out misaligned strategies and anchor us to what truly matters for scalability, usability and long-term impact.

1. **Supports Automation and Standardization at scale**   
   * Manual, ticket based processes cannot scale with the growth of our teams and cloud usage  
   * Solutions must enable automation of infrastructure provisioning, service configuration and common workflows  
   * Standardization should be enforced through golden paths and infrastructure as code patterns that remove ambiguity and reduce room for error  
2. **Follows a Composable Architecture Model**   
   * The platform must be designed with modularity in mind. That means components in the IDP should be  
     * interchangeable (swapping fithub actions for gitlab CLI should not require a full redesign)  
     * Independently maintainable and replaceable without disrupting other layers of the system  
   * This composability enables teams to adopt new tooling or scale patterns without needing full platform rewrites  
3. **Embrace the Platform-as-a-Product mindset**   
   * Solutions should be designed and delivered with the engineer as customer lens  
   * Clear documentation, discoverability, curated user experiences and feedback loops must be baked in  
   * Platforms are not just tools, they are products. They must be evaluated on usability, adoption, and satisfaction not just functional output  
4. **Enables Team autonomy and Speed**   
   * High performing teams must be able to move at their owwn pace without being blocked by centralized bottlenecks  
   * Solutions must support self-service capabilities allowing teams to provision infrastructure and services independently, safely and within approved guardrails  
5. **Ensure Cost Visibility and Governance**   
   * Infrastructure decisions must be made with an understanding of their financial impact  
   * Solutions must include tagging strategies and visibility mechanisms that surface cost data early in the decision-making process or enable fast follow optimizations

**Guiding Principles** 

Ultimately, any solution or decision we make should be anchored in a shared set of platform guiding principles:

* **Stability, Cost-effectiveness and security:** These principles guide how we manage and prioritize opportunities related to operational resilience, financial impact and risk  
* **Modular, Adaptive and Self-service**: These principles guide how we design platform experiences that scale, evolve and empower teams to move quickly and safely

These principles serve as the lens through which we evaluate tradeoffs and make decisions. A successful platform is one that can strike the right balance, delivering the right level of abstraction while maintaining flexibility and control.

The **Solution** section presents the solution or possible solutions to the problem, in detail. Some considerations:

*   
  * Each solution should be presented in detail, with good evidence for information provided.  
  * Solutions should be logically aligned with the problem. If you have framed the cause of a parking problem as “too many drivers,” additional parking spaces may not be the most logical solution: the solution should reduce the number of drivers.  
  * In some white papers, authors describe the strengths and weaknesses of current solutions. This can be done within the main Solution section, or it can be a separate **Evaluation **or** Critique**

Conclusion

Over the past year, our organization has made important strides in defining a platform strategy that works not just in theory but in practice. This white paper reflects that momentum and frames the next chapter of our journey.

We’ve aligned to a vision in that **a platform that empowers teams to move fast and make smart, sustainable decisions from day one to day done.** 

We’ve taken deliberate steps to introduce platform solutions and experiences.

We’ve been honest about what’s still ahead

·Friction still exists in onboarding and provisioning

·Platform solutions are not automated

·We must continue learning, measuring and iterating to ensure we’re solving the right problems in the right way

The industry data is clear, high performing teams don’t get there by accident. They invest in internal platforms that standardize what should be consistent, automate what should be repeatable and empower engineers to focus on value.

We’re on that path and we have an opportunity right now to move faster, more intentionally and more collaboratively. This isn’t a call for more tools. It’s a call for more connection.

·Between developers and the platform

·Between different platform teams

·Between friction and opportunity

·Between strategy and execution

·Between the present and what comes next

**Next Steps** 

As we continue to evolve, our focus should be on

·Platform solutions with investment in automation

·Instrumenting the experience to uncover bottlenecks and friction points

The platform is not the end product. It’s the engine that powers every product team at Best Buy.
