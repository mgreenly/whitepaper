Platform Solutons Automation (PSA)
==================================
  * This is the central proposal of the whitepaper being written.

Dev Customer
============
  * We provide services to internal teams.  We often refer to them as the "Dev Customer"

Stratus
=======
  * The developer portal created and maintained by the "Orchestration & Pipelines" Team


Dev Portal
==========
  * The org has a customized [Backstage](https://backstage.io/) implementation that is owned by teams under Michelle Porkrzywinski.  It is commonly referred to as "The Dev Portal".  It currently provides very little of the traditional feature expected in a dev portal.  It primarily serves as a place to aggregate documentation.
