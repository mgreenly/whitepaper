# Platform Automation Orchestrator Service

## Executive Summary

The Platform Automation Orchestrator (PAO) is the foundational technology component that transforms developer experience from weeks of manual provisioning to hours of self-service automation. Operating as a stateless REST API within the Integration and Delivery Plane, PAO orchestrates the entire service lifecycle from catalog presentation through automated fulfillment, enabling platform teams to maintain ownership while developers gain unprecedented agility.

## Strategic Context

### Business Problem
Current developer provisioning requires navigating multiple JIRA tickets across compute, storage, messaging, and networking teams, creating multi-week delays that directly constrain innovation velocity. This fragmentation forces engineers to become experts in internal bureaucracy rather than software delivery.

### Solution Architecture
PAO implements a convergence-point model where platform teams define services through structured YAML documents in a central catalog repository. These documents serve dual purposes: generating dynamic UI forms for the developer portal and providing technical definitions for automated fulfillment. This creates seamless self-service while preserving team autonomy and enabling progressive automation.

## Service Architecture

### Five-Plane Integration
PAO operates within the **Integration and Delivery Plane** while orchestrating across all reference architecture planes:

- **Developer Control Plane**: Provides unified catalog API for developer portal integration
- **Security and Compliance Plane**: Enforces RBAC, audit trails, and policy validation
- **Monitoring and Logging Plane**: Comprehensive observability for request lifecycle
- **Resource Plane**: Orchestrates provisioning across compute, storage, messaging, and networking

### Core Design Principles

1. **Document-Driven Architecture**: All service definitions live in version-controlled YAML, enabling GitOps workflows
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Teams start with manual JIRA fulfillment, evolve to full automation at their pace
3. **Variable Substitution**: Rich templating system for dynamic service configuration
4. **Action Composition**: Sequential action chains with retry, rollback, and error handling
5. **Stateless Orchestration**: Horizontally scalable, cloud-native service design

## Detailed Functionality

### Catalog Management Engine

**Repository Integration**
- Monitors catalog repository for changes via webhooks or polling
- Validates YAML documents against comprehensive JSON schema
- Caches processed catalog items with automatic refresh
- Supports multi-environment catalog synchronization

**Schema Validation**
- Enforces required sections: header, presentation, fulfillment.manual
- Validates field types, references, and conditional logic
- Prevents duplicate IDs and maintains referential integrity
- Provides detailed validation error reporting

**Dynamic Form Generation**
- Transforms presentation definitions into JSON schema for UI frameworks
- Supports complex field types: string, text, integer, number, boolean, selection, multi-selection, date, datetime, email, url, password, file, json, yaml
- Implements conditional field display based on user selections
- Generates client-side validation rules

### Request Orchestration System

**Request Lifecycle Management**
```
Submitted → Validated → Queued → In Progress → Completed/Failed
```

**Variable Substitution Engine**
- `{{fields.field_id}}` - User input values from presentation fields
- `{{header.id}}` - Catalog item metadata (id, name, version, owner)
- `{{request.id}}` - Unique request identifier (UUID)
- `{{request.timestamp}}` - ISO 8601 request submission time
- `{{request.user}}` - Requesting user (email, roles, organization)
- `{{env.VARIABLE}}` - Environment variables for secrets/configuration
- `{{response.action_name.field}}` - Previous action outputs for chaining

**Action Execution Framework**
- Sequential action processing with dependency resolution
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery procedures
- Configurable retry logic with exponential backoff
- Rollback capabilities for failed provisions
- Real-time status updates via WebSocket connections
