## Architectural Overview

### Core Architectural Principles

1. **Document-Driven Design**: All resource definitions exist as versioned YAML documents
2. **Catalog-Centric**: The catalog repository is the single source of truth for available resources
3. **Stateless Processing**: Each request is self-contained with all necessary context
4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Manual processes evolve to automation without disruption
5. **Team Autonomy**: Platform teams maintain control over their resource definitions
6. **Fail-Safe Operations**: Failures require human intervention - no automatic recovery that could cause damage

### Service Boundaries

**PAO Responsibilities**:
- Request orchestration and state management
- Variable substitution and template processing
- Catalog synchronization from GitHub repository
- API gateway for developer interactions
- Fulfillment task execution:
  - JIRA ticket creation
  - REST API calls
  - GitHub commit operations
  - GitHub workflow dispatch

**Platform Team Responsibilities**:
- Actual resource provisioning (databases, compute, storage)
- Resource lifecycle management and state
- JIRA ticket template content and required fields
- Resource-specific validation rules and constraints

## Document-Driven Convergence Model

### The Convergence Point

The catalog repository (`platform-automation-repository`) serves as the convergence point where:

1. **Platform Teams Contribute**: Each team defines their resources as YAML documents
2. **Schema Enforcement**: All documents conform to CatalogItem or CatalogBundle schemas
3. **Resource Discovery**: PAO consumes these documents to build the resource catalog
4. **Dynamic Forms**: Input definitions generate forms in the developer portal
5. **Fulfillment Templates**: Action definitions determine how requests are processed

### Catalog Document Types

**CatalogItem**: Individual resource offerings
- Metadata: Identity, ownership, and classification
- Input Form: Dynamic field definitions with validation
- Fulfillment Items: JIRA tickets (Phase 1) or automated APIs (Phase 2+)

**CatalogBundle**: Composite resource packages
- Components: References to multiple CatalogItems
- Dependencies: Execution order and relationships
- Orchestration: Sequential processing with JIRA linking

### Progressive Enhancement Model

```
Phase 1: Foundation - Manual JIRA
├── All resources use JIRA tickets
└── Platform teams fulfill manually

Phase 2: Mixed Mode Automation
├── Some resources automated
├── Others remain JIRA-based
└── Teams migrate at own pace

Phase 3: Full Automation
├── Most resources automated
└── JIRA for exceptions
```

### Ownership Model

- **Platform Teams**: Own catalog item definitions within their designated categories, define fulfillment templates, and maintain resource-specific documentation
- **PAO Team**: Owns the orchestration service, maintains catalog repository structure and schemas, develops and maintains the CLI tool (devctl), and ensures overall system health

## API Design Specification

### RESTful API Architecture

The service exposes a RESTful API organized into logical resource collections:

**Catalog Resources** (`/api/v1/catalog`)
- `GET /catalog` - List available resources with filtering
- `GET /catalog/{item-id}` - Get resource details and form schema
- `GET /catalog/{item-id}/form` - Get rendered form definition
- `POST /catalog/refresh` - Force catalog synchronization

**Request Resources** (`/api/v1/requests`)
- `POST /requests` - Submit array of resource requests (catalog items and/or bundles)
- `GET /requests` - List user's requests with filtering
- `GET /requests/{request-id}` - Get request details including task progress
- `GET /requests/{request-id}/status` - Get current status and processing state
- `GET /requests/{request-id}/logs` - Get execution logs
- `POST /requests/{request-id}/retry` - Retry failed request (re-enqueue)
- `POST /requests/{request-id}/abort` - Abort failed request
- `POST /requests/{request-id}/escalate` - Escalate to support

**Queue Management** (`/api/v1/queue`)
- `GET /queue/stats` - Queue depth, message age, processing rate (main and DLQ)
- `GET /queue/messages` - List messages in main queue
- `GET /queue/dlq/messages` - List messages in dead letter queue
- `GET /queue/messages/{message-group-id}` - Get all messages for a request
- `POST /queue/dlq/{message-id}/redrive` - Move message from DLQ back to main queue

**Health Resources** (`/api/v1/health`)
- `GET /health` - Service health status
- `GET /health/ready` - Readiness probe
- `GET /version` - Version information

**Platform Tools** (`/api/v1/tools`)
- `POST /tools/validate` - Validate catalog item
- `POST /tools/preview` - Preview form rendering
- `POST /tools/test-variables` - Test variable substitution

**Integration Endpoints**
- `POST /webhooks/github` - GitHub catalog updates

### API Design Patterns

**Authentication**
- AWS IAM Signature authentication (SigV4)
- All authenticated users have full access
- No authorization layer (future phase)

**Request/Response Patterns**
- Consistent JSON structure with envelope
- Standardized error response format
- Cursor-based pagination for lists
- Field filtering and sparse fieldsets

**Idempotency & Safety**
- GET requests are safe and cacheable
- POST requests include idempotency keys
- Retry-safe operation design
- Correlation IDs for request tracing

### Request Payload Structure

**Request Submission Format**:

The `POST /requests` endpoint accepts an array of resource items, where each item can reference either a catalog item or bundle:

```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "schemaVersion": "catalog/v1",
      "catalogItemId": "database-aurora-postgresql",
      "input": {
        "name": "my-database",
        "basic": {
          "instanceName": "prod-db-01",
          "instanceClass": "db.r5.large"
        },
        "storage": {
          "storageSize": 100,
          "encrypted": true
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "schemaVersion": "catalog/v1",
      "bundleId": "full-application-stack",
      "input": {
        "name": "my-app-stack",
        "application": {
          "appName": "frontend",
          "containerImage": "myapp:latest"
        },
        "database": {
          "instanceName": "app-db"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Key Characteristics**:
- Each item contains either `catalogItemId` OR `bundleId` (mutually exclusive)
- `schemaVersion` identifies the catalog schema version
- `input` contains user-provided answers with nested group structure matching the form definition
- The required `name` field appears at the top level of `input`
- All other fields are organized within their respective groups
- Fulfillment instructions are NOT included - they are retrieved from the catalog

### Error Handling Architecture

**Error Classification**:
- **4xx Client Errors**: Invalid requests, authentication failures, validation errors
- **5xx Server Errors**: Internal failures, integration errors, resource exhaustion

**Error Response Structure**:
```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
    "message": "Human-readable description",
    "details": [{"field": "name", "issue": "pattern mismatch"}],
    "correlation_id": "uuid"
  }
}
```

## Request Processing Architecture

### Terminology Distinction

**Important**: This document distinguishes between:
- **Fulfillment Items**: The action definitions in the catalog document (e.g., JIRA ticket creation, REST API call)
- **Fulfillment Tasks**: The queued messages that execute those items at runtime

There is a 1:1 relationship between fulfillment items and fulfillment tasks - each item defined in the catalog results in exactly one queued task.

### Asynchronous Processing Architecture

The service employs an asynchronous queue-based architecture to ensure reliable fulfillment task processing and enable horizontal scaling.

**Request and Fulfillment Task Processing Pipeline**:

1. **Request Reception & Validation**
   - Receive array of items (catalog items and/or bundles)
   - Generate correlation ID for distributed tracing
   - For each item in the array:
     - Validate `schemaVersion` and item identifier (`catalogItemId` or `bundleId`)
     - Retrieve catalog definition from cache/database
     - Validate input against form schema and constraints
     - Verify required `name` field and patterns

2. **Request Persistence & Task Generation**
   - Create separate request record for each item in the array
   - For each request:
     - If catalog item: Generate fulfillment tasks from its fulfillment items
     - If bundle: 
       - Expand bundle into component catalog items (maintaining sequence)
       - Generate fulfillment tasks for each component's fulfillment items
   - Store all fulfillment tasks in database with "pending" state
   - Enqueue fulfillment task messages to SQS FIFO queue (separate message group per request)
   - Return array of tracking IDs to client immediately

3. **Fulfillment Task Processing**
   - Worker dequeues fulfillment task from queue
   - Check parent request state (skip if aborted)
   - Parse templates for variable references
   - Resolve variables from four namespaces
   - Execute action (JIRA, REST API, etc.)
   - Capture results and external references

4. **State Management**
   - Update fulfillment task status in database
   - Update parent request progress (e.g., "3 of 5 tasks completed")
   - Record task outputs for subsequent task use
   - Create immutable audit log entries
   - Enqueue next fulfillment task if bundle sequence

5. **Completion & Cleanup**
   - Mark request as completed when all tasks succeed
   - Handle partial completion states
   - Maintain full task execution history

**Key Characteristics**:
- Fulfillment tasks are queued, not requests
- Request state persisted immediately on submission
- Each fulfillment task references parent request ID
- Horizontal scaling through worker pools
- Real-time progress updates via API polling

### Request State Machine

```
[submitted] ──→ [processing] ──→ [completed]
                      │
                      ↓
                  [failed] ──→ [aborted]
                      ├──→ [retrying]
                      └──→ [escalated]
```

**Request State Definitions**:
- `submitted`: Request received, validated, and persisted
- `processing`: One or more fulfillment tasks are active
- `completed`: All fulfillment tasks successful
- `failed`: One or more fulfillment tasks failed, awaiting human decision
- `retrying`: Human initiated retry of failed tasks
- `aborted`: User chose to abandon request
- `escalated`: Failed tasks converted to JIRA tickets for manual fulfillment

### Fulfillment Task State Machine

Each fulfillment task within a request has its own state machine:

```
[pending] ──→ [queued] ──→ [processing] ──→ [completed]
                  │             │
                  │             ├──→ [failed]
                  │             └──→ [skipped]
                  │
                  └──→ [stuck]
```

**Fulfillment Task State Definitions**:
- `pending`: Task created but not yet queued
- `queued`: Message in SQS FIFO queue awaiting processing
- `processing`: Worker actively executing the task
- `completed`: Task executed successfully
- `failed`: Task execution failed
- `skipped`: Task skipped due to parent request abort or previous task failure
- `stuck`: Message not progressing (visibility timeout exceeded multiple times)

**State Coordination**:
- Request state aggregates fulfillment task states
- Failed task triggers request state transition to "failed"
- Abort request causes remaining tasks to transition to "skipped"
- All tasks "completed" triggers request "completed"

### Bundle Orchestration

When a bundle is submitted in the request array, the orchestrator:

1. **Bundle Expansion**: 
   - Load the bundle definition from catalog
   - Resolve all referenced CatalogItems
   - Create a sequence of catalog items based on bundle components

2. **Input Distribution**:
   - Map user inputs to appropriate catalog items
   - Each component receives relevant input fields from the bundle's form
   - The required `name` field is available to all components

3. **Sequential Processing**:
   - Process components in dependency order
   - Each component's fulfillment items execute in sequence
   - JIRA tickets linked with "blocks/blocked by" relationships

4. **Variable Namespace Management**:
   - All components share the same `.current` namespace (user inputs)
   - `.output` namespace accumulates across all components
   - Each component accesses outputs from previous components

5. **Failure Handling**: 
   - Stop processing on first failure
   - Mark remaining tasks as "skipped"
   - Maintain partial completion state

## Queue Architecture

### SQS FIFO Queue Design

The service uses AWS SQS FIFO queues to ensure ordered processing of fulfillment tasks within each request while allowing parallel processing across different requests.

**Queue Structure**:
- **Fulfillment Task Queue**: Primary FIFO queue for all fulfillment task processing
- **Dead Letter Queue**: FIFO queue for tasks that fail after 3 receive attempts
- **Message Group ID**: Request UUID ensures all fulfillment tasks for a request process in order

**How FIFO Message Groups Work**:

SQS FIFO queues use Message Group IDs to ensure ordering within a group while allowing parallel processing across groups:

- **Message Group ID = Request UUID**: Each request's fulfillment tasks share the same message group
- **Ordering Guarantee**: All fulfillment tasks with the same group ID process in exact FIFO order
- **Parallel Processing**: Different message groups (different requests) process simultaneously
- **Example**: Two bundles processing concurrently:
  - Bundle A (3 fulfillment tasks): A1 → A2 → A3 (group ID: Bundle A request ID)
  - Bundle B (4 fulfillment tasks): B1 → B2 → B3 → B4 (group ID: Bundle B request ID)
  - Parallel processing enabled by different group IDs

### Message Flow

**Request Submission**:
1. API validates array of items and generates request IDs
2. For each item in the array:
   - Create separate request record with "submitted" status
   - If bundle: expand to component catalog items
   - Generate fulfillment tasks based on catalog definitions
   - Assign unique message group ID (request UUID)
3. Enqueue first fulfillment task for each request to SQS FIFO
4. Return array of request IDs to client immediately

**Parallel Request Processing**:
- Each item in the submission array becomes an independent request
- Requests process in parallel (different message group IDs)
- No dependencies between items in the submission array
- Bundle components within a single request process sequentially

**Fulfillment Task Processing**:
1. Worker dequeues fulfillment task message from queue
2. Checks parent request state (skips execution if aborted)
3. Executes the task action (JIRA ticket creation, API call, etc.)
4. Updates fulfillment task status in database
5. If bundle with sequential tasks, enqueues next task with same message group ID
6. Process continues until all tasks complete or one fails

### Worker Design

**Worker Architecture**:
- Unified worker implementation for all fulfillment item types
- Dynamic routing based on fulfillment item configuration
- Horizontal scaling based on queue metrics
- Stateless design with database-backed state

### Error Handling

**Failure Handling Pattern**:
- If fulfillment task fails, mark task as "failed" and parent request as "failed"
- No automatic retries at application level - matches existing "fail-safe" principle
- Subsequent tasks in sequence are not queued (fail-fast approach)
- Failed requests handled via API endpoints:
  - `POST /requests/{request-id}/retry` - Retry failed and unprocessed tasks
  - `POST /requests/{request-id}/abort` - Abort request, remaining tasks marked as "skipped"
  - `POST /requests/{request-id}/escalate` - Convert failed and unprocessed tasks to JIRA tickets

**Abort Handling**:
- When request is aborted, update request state to "aborted" in database
- Already-queued fulfillment tasks still dequeue but check parent request state
- Tasks finding aborted parent mark themselves as "skipped" and exit
- No need to remove messages from queue - cleaner than queue manipulation

**Escalation Process**:
- Creates JIRA tickets for failed task and all subsequent unprocessed tasks
- Each JIRA ticket contains:
  - Description of the failure and error details
  - List of successfully completed tasks with their outputs
  - List of tasks already converted to JIRA tickets with ticket numbers
  - Setup details for the specific task
- JIRA tickets are linked with "blocks/blocked by" relationships:
  - Task 3 ticket blocked by Task 2 ticket
  - Maintains dependency chain for manual fulfillment

**Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)**:
- Captures fulfillment task messages that fail after maximum retry attempts
- Prevents failed messages from blocking queue processing
- Preserves message content for debugging and analysis
- Requires manual intervention for resolution

**Queue Operations (devctl)**:
- Display queue metrics and statistics
- List fulfillment tasks by processing state
- Examine dead letter queue contents
- Redrive DLQ messages to main queue
- Show task progress for requests (e.g., "3 of 5 completed")
- Execute batch operations on failures

## Variable Substitution Engine

### Four-Namespace Variable System

The orchestrator implements a hierarchical namespace system for template variable resolution:

**1. Current Namespace (`.current.*`)**
- Contains user input from request form
- Structure: `{{.current.name}}` (required field)
- Group fields: `{{.current.groupId.fieldId}}`
- Immutable during request processing
- Shared across all bundle components

**2. Output Namespace (`.output.*`)**
- Accumulates computed values from fulfillment task executions
- Flat structure: `{{.output.userSelectedKey}}`
- Built progressively during execution
- Each fulfillment task can add new keys
- Available to subsequent fulfillment tasks

**3. Metadata Namespace (`.metadata.*`)**
- Static catalog item metadata
- Structure: `{{.metadata.catalogItemId.field}}`
- Includes standard fields (id, name, version)
- Includes custom metadata fields
- Read-only during execution

**4. System Namespace (`.system.*`)**
- Platform-provided context
- Request context: `{{.system.requestId}}`
- User context: `{{.system.user.email}}`
- Environment: `{{.system.platform.region}}`
- Generated values: `{{.system.timestamp}}`

### Template Processing Architecture

**Processing Phases**:

1. **Parse Phase**
   - Identify variable references `{{.namespace.path}}`
   - Extract namespace and path components
   - Build dependency graph

2. **Validation Phase**
   - Verify namespace exists
   - Check path accessibility
   - Validate circular dependencies
   - Type compatibility checks

3. **Resolution Phase**
   - Fetch values from namespaces
   - Apply type conversions
   - Handle missing values (empty string)
   - Process nested paths

4. **Transformation Phase**
   - Apply transformation functions
   - Format for target context (JSON, YAML)
   - Escape special characters
   - Handle array/object serialization

### Variable Scoping Rules

**Access Control**:
- Templates access only predefined namespaces
- No dynamic namespace creation permitted
- Request isolation enforced (no cross-request access)
- Bundle components share `.current` namespace values

**Sequential Processing**:
- `.output` namespace accumulates progressively
- Subsequent fulfillment tasks access all prior outputs
- Failed fulfillment tasks leave no output values
- Retry operations reset output namespace

## Integration Patterns

### Catalog Synchronization

The service maintains an up-to-date view of the catalog repository through event-driven synchronization:

**Synchronization Flow**:
1. GitHub webhook triggered on repository changes
2. Webhook signature validation for security
3. Filter for relevant changes (*.yaml in catalog/ and bundles/)
4. Schema validation of modified documents
5. Update in-memory cache for performance
6. Persist to database for durability

**Loading Strategies**:
- **Startup**: Full catalog load from repository
- **Runtime**: Event-driven updates via webhooks
- **Recovery**: Manual refresh endpoint available
- **Caching**: In-memory with configurable TTL
- **Persistence**: Database backup for resilience

**Team Mapping**:
- Parse CODEOWNERS file for team assignments
- Map teams to catalog categories
- Maintain ownership metadata for reference

### JIRA Integration

**Multi-Instance Configuration**:
- Support for multiple JIRA instances
- Project-based routing from templates
- Per-instance authentication and connection pooling
- Configurable timeout and retry policies

**Ticket Creation Flow**:
1. Process template with resolved variables
2. Construct JIRA payload with required fields
3. Include custom fields from catalog definition
4. Submit via JIRA REST API
5. Store ticket reference (key and URL)
6. Map JIRA response to request state

**Status Management**:
- On-demand status queries (no polling)
- Direct JIRA API calls for current state
- State mapping between JIRA and PAO
- Consistent status representation to clients

### Additional Integration Patterns

## Data Architecture

### Persistence Strategy

The service uses a relational database with JSONB for flexibility:

**Core Database Tables**:

1. **Requests**
   - Request ID (UUID, primary key)
   - Item type (catalog_item or bundle)
   - Item reference (catalogItemId or bundleId)
   - Original bundle ID (if expanded from bundle)
   - User identity and team membership
   - Current state (submitted, processing, completed, failed, aborted, escalated)
   - Total task count and completed task count
   - Input data (JSONB with nested group structure)
   - Correlation ID for tracing
   - Submission batch ID (links requests from same submission)
   - Timestamps and audit metadata

2. **Fulfillment Tasks**
   - Task ID (UUID, primary key)
   - Parent request ID (foreign key)
   - Sequence index (order within request)
   - Item type (jira-ticket, rest-api, etc.)
   - Task state (pending, queued, processing, completed, failed, skipped, stuck)
   - Item configuration (JSONB from catalog fulfillment item)
   - Execution outputs (JSONB)
   - External references (e.g., JIRA keys)
   - Error context if failed
   - Processing timestamps

3. **Catalog Cache**
   - Catalog item definitions
