## Strategic Context

The Platform Automation Orchestrator (PAO) serves as the central orchestration capability within the Integration and Delivery Plane of the Internal Developer Platform. PAO transforms multi-week provisioning delays into same-day resource delivery by providing a document-driven convergence point where platform teams define their service offerings through YAML documents.

This approach enables self-service provisioning while maintaining team autonomy, reducing provisioning times from weeks to hours in Phase 1 (JIRA-based) and eventually to minutes in subsequent phases (automation-enabled).

- Catalog schema and specifications: [catalog.md](catalog.md)
- CLI tool documentation: [devctl.md](devctl.md)

## Architectural Overview

### Position in Reference Architecture

PAO operates within the **Integration and Delivery Plane**, serving as the orchestration hub that connects:

- **Developer Control Plane**: Where developers interact via portal or CLI
- **Resource Plane**: Where actual Platform Team Resource provisioning occurs
- **Security & Compliance Plane**: For policy enforcement and secrets management
- **Monitoring & Logging Plane**: For observability and audit trails

### Core Architectural Principles

1. **Document-Driven Design**: All resource definitions exist as versioned YAML documents
2. **Catalog-Centric**: The catalog repository is the single source of truth for available resources
3. **Stateless Processing**: Each request is self-contained with all necessary context
4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Manual processes evolve to automation without disruption
5. **Team Autonomy**: Platform teams maintain control over their resource definitions
6. **Fail-Safe Operations**: Failures require human intervention - no automatic recovery that could cause damage

### Service Boundaries

**PAO Responsibilities**:
- Request orchestration and state management
- Variable substitution and template processing
- Catalog synchronization from GitHub repository
- API gateway for developer interactions
- Fulfillment action execution:
  - JIRA ticket creation
  - REST API calls
  - GitHub commit operations
  - GitHub workflow dispatch

**Platform Team Responsibilities**:
- Actual resource provisioning (databases, compute, storage)
- Resource lifecycle management and state
- JIRA ticket template content and required fields
- Resource-specific validation rules and constraints

## Document-Driven Convergence Model

### The Convergence Point

The catalog repository (`platform-automation-repository`) serves as the convergence point where:

1. **Platform Teams Contribute**: Each team defines their resources as YAML documents
2. **Schema Enforcement**: All documents conform to CatalogItem or CatalogBundle schemas
3. **Resource Discovery**: PAO consumes these documents to build the resource catalog
4. **Dynamic Forms**: Input definitions generate forms in the developer portal
5. **Fulfillment Templates**: Action definitions determine how requests are processed

### Catalog Document Types

**CatalogItem**: Individual resource offerings
- Metadata: Identity, ownership, and classification
- Input Form: Dynamic field definitions with validation
- Fulfillment Actions: JIRA tickets (Phase 1) or automated APIs (Phase 2+)

**CatalogBundle**: Composite resource packages
- Components: References to multiple CatalogItems
- Dependencies: Execution order and relationships
- Orchestration: Sequential processing with JIRA linking

### Progressive Enhancement Model

```
Phase 1: Foundation - Manual JIRA
├── All resources use JIRA tickets
├── Platform teams fulfill manually
└── Hours instead of weeks

Phase 2: Mixed Mode Automation
├── Some resources automated
├── Others remain JIRA-based
└── Teams migrate at own pace

Phase 3: Full Automation
├── Most resources automated
├── JIRA for exceptions
└── Minutes instead of hours
```

### Ownership Model

- **Platform Teams**: Own catalog item definitions within their designated categories, define fulfillment templates, and maintain resource-specific documentation
- **PAO Team**: Owns the orchestration service, maintains catalog repository structure and schemas, develops and maintains the CLI tool (devctl), and ensures overall system health

## API Design Specification

### RESTful API Architecture

The service exposes a RESTful API organized into logical resource collections:

**Catalog Resources** (`/api/v1/catalog`)
- `GET /catalog` - List available resources with filtering
- `GET /catalog/{item-id}` - Get resource details and form schema
- `GET /catalog/{item-id}/form` - Get rendered form definition
- `POST /catalog/refresh` - Force catalog synchronization

**Request Resources** (`/api/v1/requests`)
- `POST /requests` - Submit new resource request
- `GET /requests` - List user's requests with filtering
- `GET /requests/{request-id}` - Get request details including task progress
- `GET /requests/{request-id}/status` - Get current status and processing state
- `GET /requests/{request-id}/logs` - Get execution logs
- `POST /requests/{request-id}/retry` - Retry failed request (re-enqueue)
- `POST /requests/{request-id}/abort` - Abort failed request
- `POST /requests/{request-id}/escalate` - Escalate to support

**Queue Management** (`/api/v1/queue`)
- `GET /queue/stats` - Queue depth, message age, processing rate (main and DLQ)
- `GET /queue/messages` - List messages in main queue
- `GET /queue/dlq/messages` - List messages in dead letter queue
- `GET /queue/messages/{message-group-id}` - Get all messages for a request

### API Design Patterns

**Authentication**
- Identity federation through organizational IAM
- Request signing for API authentication

**Request/Response Patterns**
- Consistent JSON structure with envelope
- Standardized error response format
- Cursor-based pagination for lists
- Field filtering and sparse fieldsets

**Idempotency & Safety**
- GET requests are safe and cacheable
- POST requests include idempotency keys
- Retry-safe operation design
- Correlation IDs for request tracing

### Error Handling Architecture

**Error Classification**:
- **4xx Client Errors**: Invalid requests, authentication failures, validation errors
- **5xx Server Errors**: Internal failures, integration errors, resource exhaustion

**Error Response Structure**:
```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
    "message": "Human-readable description",
    "details": [{"field": "name", "issue": "pattern mismatch"}],
    "correlation_id": "uuid"
  }
}
```

## Request Processing Architecture

### Asynchronous Processing Architecture

The service employs an asynchronous queue-based architecture to ensure reliable fulfillment task processing and enable horizontal scaling. This design replaces multi-week manual delays with same-day delivery through automated orchestration.

**Request and Fulfillment Task Processing Pipeline**:

1. **Request Reception & Validation**
   - Receive request with catalog item ID and form data
   - Generate correlation ID for distributed tracing
   - Validate against catalog schema and constraints
   - Verify required fields and patterns

2. **Request Persistence & Task Generation**
   - Persist request to database with initial state
   - Generate fulfillment tasks based on catalog definition
   - For bundles: create one fulfillment task per component
   - Store fulfillment tasks in database with "pending" state
   - Enqueue fulfillment task messages to SQS FIFO queue
   - Return tracking ID to client immediately

3. **Fulfillment Task Processing**
   - Worker dequeues fulfillment task from queue
   - Check parent request state (skip if aborted)
   - Parse templates for variable references
   - Resolve variables from four namespaces
   - Execute action (JIRA, REST API, etc.)
   - Capture results and external references

4. **State Management**
   - Update fulfillment task status in database
   - Update parent request progress (e.g., "3 of 5 tasks completed")
   - Record task outputs for subsequent task use
   - Create immutable audit log entries
   - Enqueue next fulfillment task if bundle sequence

5. **Completion & Cleanup**
   - Mark request as completed when all tasks succeed
   - Handle partial completion states
   - Maintain full task execution history

**Key Characteristics**:
- Fulfillment tasks are queued, not requests
- Request state persisted immediately on submission
- Each fulfillment task references parent request ID
- Horizontal scaling through worker pools
- Real-time progress updates via API polling

### Request State Machine

```
[submitted] ──→ [processing] ──→ [completed]
                      │
                      ↓
                  [failed] ──→ [aborted]
                      ├──→ [retrying]
                      └──→ [escalated]
```

**Request State Definitions**:
- `submitted`: Request received, validated, and persisted
- `processing`: One or more fulfillment tasks are active
- `completed`: All fulfillment tasks successful
- `failed`: One or more fulfillment tasks failed, awaiting human decision
- `retrying`: Human initiated retry of failed tasks
- `aborted`: User chose to abandon request
- `escalated`: Failed tasks converted to JIRA tickets for manual fulfillment

### Fulfillment Task State Machine

Each fulfillment task within a request has its own state machine:

```
[pending] ──→ [queued] ──→ [processing] ──→ [completed]
                  │             │
                  │             ├──→ [failed]
                  │             └──→ [skipped]
                  │
                  └──→ [stuck]
```

**Fulfillment Task State Definitions**:
- `pending`: Task created but not yet queued
- `queued`: Message in SQS FIFO queue awaiting processing
- `processing`: Worker actively executing the task
- `completed`: Task executed successfully
- `failed`: Task execution failed
- `skipped`: Task skipped due to parent request abort or previous task failure
- `stuck`: Message not progressing (visibility timeout exceeded multiple times)

**State Coordination**:
- Request state aggregates fulfillment task states
- Failed task triggers request state transition to "failed"
- Abort request causes remaining tasks to transition to "skipped"
- All tasks "completed" triggers request "completed"

### Bundle Orchestration

For CatalogBundles, the orchestrator:

1. **Component Resolution**: Load referenced CatalogItems
2. **Dependency Ordering**: Sort components by dependencies
3. **Sequential Execution**: Process components in order
4. **JIRA Linking**: Create "blocks/blocked by" relationships
5. **Output Accumulation**: Build `.output` namespace progressively
6. **Failure Handling**: Stop on first failure

## Queue Architecture

### SQS FIFO Queue Design

The service uses AWS SQS FIFO queues to ensure ordered processing of fulfillment tasks within each request while allowing parallel processing across different requests.

**Queue Structure**:
- **Fulfillment Task Queue**: Primary FIFO queue for all fulfillment task processing
- **Dead Letter Queue**: FIFO queue for tasks that fail after 3 receive attempts
- **Message Group ID**: Request UUID ensures all fulfillment tasks for a request process in order

**How FIFO Message Groups Work**:

SQS FIFO queues use Message Group IDs to ensure ordering within a group while allowing parallel processing across groups:

- **Message Group ID = Request UUID**: Each request's fulfillment tasks share the same message group
- **Ordering Guarantee**: All fulfillment tasks with the same group ID process in exact FIFO order
- **Parallel Processing**: Different message groups (different requests) process simultaneously
- **Example**: Two bundles processing concurrently:
  - Bundle A (3 fulfillment tasks): A1 → A2 → A3 (group ID: Bundle A request ID)
  - Bundle B (4 fulfillment tasks): B1 → B2 → B3 → B4 (group ID: Bundle B request ID)
  - Parallel processing enabled by different group IDs

### Message Flow

**Request Submission**:
1. API validates request and generates request ID
2. Persists request to database with "submitted" status
3. Creates fulfillment tasks in database based on catalog definition
4. Enqueues first fulfillment task to SQS FIFO with request ID as message group ID
5. Returns request ID to client immediately

**Fulfillment Task Processing**:
1. Worker dequeues fulfillment task message from queue
2. Checks parent request state (skips execution if aborted)
3. Executes the task action (JIRA ticket creation, API call, etc.)
4. Updates fulfillment task status in database
5. If bundle with sequential tasks, enqueues next task with same message group ID
6. Process continues until all tasks complete or one fails

### Worker Design

**Worker Architecture**:
- Unified worker implementation for all action types
- Dynamic routing based on action configuration
- Horizontal scaling based on queue metrics
- Stateless design with database-backed state

### Error Handling

**Failure Handling Pattern**:
- If fulfillment task fails, mark task as "failed" and parent request as "failed"
- No automatic retries at application level - matches existing "fail-safe" principle
- Subsequent tasks in sequence are not queued (fail-fast approach)
- Failed requests handled via API endpoints:
  - `POST /requests/{request-id}/retry` - Retry failed and unprocessed tasks
  - `POST /requests/{request-id}/abort` - Abort request, remaining tasks marked as "skipped"
  - `POST /requests/{request-id}/escalate` - Convert failed and unprocessed tasks to JIRA tickets

**Abort Handling**:
- When request is aborted, update request state to "aborted" in database
- Already-queued fulfillment tasks still dequeue but check parent request state
- Tasks finding aborted parent mark themselves as "skipped" and exit
- No need to remove messages from queue - cleaner than queue manipulation

**Escalation Process**:
- Creates JIRA tickets for failed task and all subsequent unprocessed tasks
- Each JIRA ticket contains:
  - Description of the failure and error details
  - List of successfully completed tasks with their outputs
  - List of tasks already converted to JIRA tickets with ticket numbers
  - Setup details for the specific task
- JIRA tickets are linked with "blocks/blocked by" relationships:
  - Task 3 ticket blocked by Task 2 ticket
  - Maintains dependency chain for manual fulfillment

**Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)**:
- Captures fulfillment task messages that fail after maximum retry attempts
- Prevents failed messages from blocking queue processing
- Preserves message content for debugging and analysis
- Requires manual intervention for resolution

**Queue Operations (devctl)**:
- Display queue metrics and statistics
- List fulfillment tasks by processing state
- Examine dead letter queue contents
- Redrive DLQ messages to main queue
- Show task progress for requests (e.g., "3 of 5 completed")
- Execute batch operations on failures

## Variable Substitution Engine

### Four-Namespace Variable System

The orchestrator implements a hierarchical namespace system for template variable resolution:

**1. Current Namespace (`.current.*`)**
- Contains user input from request form
- Structure: `{{.current.name}}` (required field)
- Group fields: `{{.current.groupId.fieldId}}`
- Immutable during request processing
- Shared across all bundle components

**2. Output Namespace (`.output.*`)**
- Accumulates computed values from fulfillment task executions
- Flat structure: `{{.output.userSelectedKey}}`
- Built progressively during execution
- Each fulfillment task can add new keys
- Available to subsequent fulfillment tasks

**3. Metadata Namespace (`.metadata.*`)**
- Static catalog item metadata
- Structure: `{{.metadata.catalogItemId.field}}`
- Includes standard fields (id, name, version)
- Includes custom metadata fields
- Read-only during execution

**4. System Namespace (`.system.*`)**
- Platform-provided context
- Request context: `{{.system.requestId}}`
- User context: `{{.system.user.email}}`
- Environment: `{{.system.platform.region}}`
- Generated values: `{{.system.timestamp}}`

### Template Processing Architecture

**Processing Phases**:

1. **Parse Phase**
   - Identify variable references `{{.namespace.path}}`
   - Extract namespace and path components
   - Build dependency graph

2. **Validation Phase**
   - Verify namespace exists
   - Check path accessibility
   - Validate circular dependencies
   - Type compatibility checks

3. **Resolution Phase**
   - Fetch values from namespaces
   - Apply type conversions
   - Handle missing values (empty string)
   - Process nested paths

4. **Transformation Phase**
   - Apply transformation functions
   - Format for target context (JSON, YAML)
   - Escape special characters
   - Handle array/object serialization

### Variable Scoping Rules

**Access Control**:
- Templates access only predefined namespaces
- No dynamic namespace creation permitted
- Request isolation enforced (no cross-request access)
- Bundle components share `.current` namespace values

**Sequential Processing**:
- `.output` namespace accumulates progressively
- Subsequent fulfillment tasks access all prior outputs
- Failed fulfillment tasks leave no output values
- Retry operations reset output namespace

## Integration Patterns

### Catalog Synchronization

The service maintains an up-to-date view of the catalog repository through event-driven synchronization:

**Synchronization Flow**:
1. GitHub webhook triggered on repository changes
2. Webhook signature validation for security
3. Filter for relevant changes (*.yaml in catalog/ and bundles/)
4. Schema validation of modified documents
5. Update in-memory cache for performance
6. Persist to database for durability

**Loading Strategies**:
- **Startup**: Full catalog load from repository
