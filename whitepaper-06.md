## 1. Executive Summary

The organization's current developer platform struggles to keep pace with the demands of modern application development. The reliance on a manual, ticket-based system for provisioning resources creates significant delays, forcing teams to wait before they can begin writing code. This protracted onboarding process not only stifles innovation but also represents a significant opportunity cost in a competitive market. Past attempts to address these challenges through large-scale, disruptive initiatives have failed to deliver the desired outcomes, leading to a perception that acquiring a third-party solution is the only viable path forward.

This paper presents an alternative: a progressive, value-driven approach centered on Platform Solutions Automation (PSA). The PSA is a lightweight, adaptable framework that automates the provisioning of application resources. This solution abstracts away the complexities of the underlying systems, providing a unified and streamlined experience for developers. It achieves this by establishing a curated catalog of platform services that development teams can consume on-demand, without requiring a disruptive overhaul of the existing organizational structure. By focusing on automation and a standardized Reference Architecture, the PSA model empowers development teams to self-serve the resources they need, dramatically reducing lead times and freeing them to focus on delivering value. We recommend the adoption of this strategy to foster a culture of innovation, improve operational efficiency, and provide a superior developer experience.

## 2. The Challenge: A Fragmented Development Landscape

Our organization's commitment to technological excellence is hindered by internal friction. The current process for a development team to stand up a new application is a journey through a maze of JIRA tickets submitted to numerous platform teams—compute, storage, messaging, networking, and more. This manual, disjointed workflow introduces considerable lead time, leaving our most valuable technical talent waiting for weeks to get the basic resources they need to innovate.

This inefficiency is not a reflection of the talent within our platform teams, but rather a symptom of a systemic issue. The organizational structure, with platform capabilities distributed across at least seven senior directorates, creates natural silos. Each team has optimized its own processes, but the developer experience—the end-to-end journey of the internal customer—remains fragmented.

Furthermore, the critical holiday code-freeze, extending from August to February, imposes a long period where major platform evolution is nearly impossible. This operational reality makes large-scale, "big bang" transformations exceptionally risky and difficult to execute, as resources are rightly focused on maintaining the stability of our revenue-generating systems. These failed attempts have fostered a sense of fatigue and skepticism toward large internal initiatives, pushing stakeholders to consider external vendors as a seemingly simpler solution. However, purchasing a tool will not fix the underlying process and organizational challenges; in fact, it may exacerbate them by adding another layer of complexity without addressing the core fragmentation.

## 3. The Opportunity: A Progressive, Customer-Centric Approach

We propose a strategy that diverges from past efforts by prioritizing progressive, incremental value delivery over disruptive change. Our approach is rooted in a simple but powerful idea: focus on the customer. In this context, our customers are the internal development teams who rely on the platform to build, deploy, and manage applications.

Instead of a sweeping overhaul, we will empower our existing platform teams to expose their capabilities as self-service products within a unified ecosystem. This model respects the current organizational structure and domain expertise, transforming platform teams from ticket-takers into product owners. It allows them to maintain autonomy over their services while contributing to a cohesive and seamless developer experience.

This approach is designed to deliver value quickly and iteratively, aligning with the organization's operational constraints. By introducing small, high-impact changes, we can build momentum, demonstrate success, and foster trust without disrupting the critical work of keeping our existing systems running. This is not another top-down mandate; it is a bottom-up evolution driven by the teams who know their domains best.

## 4. The Solution: Platform Solutions Automation (PSA)

The core of our recommendation is the implementation of a **Platform Solutions Automation (PSA)** capability, guided by a formal **Reference Architecture**.

### 4.1. An Opinionated Reference Architecture

To avoid the pitfalls of complexity and fragmentation that have plagued past efforts, we must anchor our platform strategy in a clear and intentionally opinionated Reference Architecture. This architecture provides a blueprint for our Internal Developer Platform (IDP), defining the essential planes of capability:

1.  **Developer Control Plane:** The user-facing interface of the IDP (e.g., a developer portal).
2.  **Integration and Delivery Plane:** The engine that connects developer requests to platform capabilities.
3.  **Platform Services Plane:** The collection of tools and services offered by the platform (e.g., databases, CI/CD, observability).
4.  **Infrastructure Plane:** The underlying compute, storage, and networking resources.

This framework is not merely a diagram; it is a set of guardrails. It ensures that every component added to our platform serves a distinct purpose and aligns with our strategic goals. By adhering to this architecture, we prevent the ad-hoc addition of redundant or misaligned "boxes and planes" that increase complexity and dilute the platform's value.

### 4.2. The Platform Orchestrator

A critical component within the **Integration and Delivery Plane** is the **Platform Orchestrator**. This is the technical and process core of our proposal, and it is enabled by the PSA. The Platform Orchestrator acts as the smart connective tissue between developers and the platform.

The PSA works by creating a centralized, machine-readable catalog of all platform service offerings. Each platform team defines its service (e.g., "provision a PostgreSQL database") in a standardized format. This definition includes the parameters a developer needs to provide (e.g., database size, region) and the automation logic required to fulfill the request.

When a developer requests a service through the portal, the Platform Orchestrator interprets the request, validates it against the catalog, and dispatches it to the appropriate platform team's existing automation or workflow engine. It abstracts the complexity of *how* a service is provisioned from the *what* a developer is requesting, creating a clean, API-driven contract between teams.

## 5. Recommendation and Path Forward

We recommend the immediate chartering of a project to implement the Platform Solutions Automation (PSA) capability, beginning with a focused pilot program. This is a confident, authoritative proposal grounded in the established principles of the Reference Architecture.

Our proposed path forward is pragmatic and iterative:

1.  **Establish the Reference Architecture:** Formally adopt the proposed architecture as the guiding framework for all platform development.
2.  **Pilot Program:** Identify one or two high-impact platform services (e.g., a common database or a standardized application environment) and a motivated development team to act as the pilot customer.
3.  **Develop the Initial PSA:** Build the minimum viable Platform Orchestrator and service catalog needed to support the pilot program.
4.  **Measure and Iterate:** Define key metrics for success, focusing on reduced lead time for provisioning and developer satisfaction. Use the learnings from the pilot to refine the PSA and expand the service catalog.

This strategy directly addresses the organization's core challenges. It offers a low-risk, high-reward alternative to expensive third-party solutions or disruptive internal reorganizations. It respects our operational constraints, leverages our existing talent, and places the focus squarely on delivering value to our internal customers. By embracing Platform Solutions Automation, we can unlock the full potential of our development teams and build a lasting competitive advantage.
