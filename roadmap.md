# IDP Orchestrator Development Roadmap

## Phase 1: Foundation & Proof of Concept (4-6 weeks)
- **Architecture Blueprint**: Document five-plane reference architecture with clear component boundaries and integration points
- **Repository Foundation**: Establish catalog repository with initial directory structure and access controls
- **Minimal Viable Schema**: Create basic CatalogItem schema supporting name, description, and simple JIRA ticket fulfillment
- **Schema Validation**: Implement JSON schema validation with automated testing pipeline
- **Single Service POC**: Deploy one platform service (e.g., database provisioning) to validate end-to-end concept

## Phase 2: Core API & Catalog Engine (6-8 weeks)
- **REST API Foundation**: Build minimal REST service with health endpoints and OpenAPI documentation
- **Catalog Processing**: Implement document ingestion from repository with validation and transformation logic
- **Request Management**: Create request submission, tracking, and status reporting capabilities
- **JIRA Integration**: Implement automated JIRA ticket creation with request context and variable substitution
- **Basic Error Handling**: Add logging, error responses, and simple retry mechanisms for failed requests

## Phase 3: Enhanced Actions & Developer Portal Integration (4-6 weeks)
- **Multi-Action Support**: Extend fulfillment engine to support REST API calls, Terraform modules, and GitHub workflows
- **Developer Portal API**: Create comprehensive endpoints for catalog browsing, form generation, and request submission
- **Authentication Layer**: Implement RBAC integration with existing identity systems
- **Real-time Updates**: Add WebSocket support for live request status updates in developer portal
- **Enhanced Schema**: Expand CatalogItem schema to support complex forms, dependencies, and metadata

## Phase 4: State Management & Reliability (4-6 weeks)
- **Resource State Tracking**: Implement simple state storage for tracking provisioned resources and request history
- **Request Lifecycle Management**: Build complete request workflow from submission through completion with status transitions
- **Rollback Capabilities**: Add rollback mechanisms for failed provisions with manual and automated triggers
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling, retry logic, and escalation paths
- **Audit Trail**: Create detailed logging and audit capabilities for compliance and troubleshooting

## Phase 5: Platform Team Enablement (6-8 weeks)
- **Onboarding Framework**: Create standardized patterns and templates for compute, database, messaging, and networking teams
- **Migration Tooling**: Build utilities to convert existing manual processes into CatalogItem definitions with validation
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Enable seamless transition from manual JIRA fulfillment to automated actions
- **Team Testing Tools**: Provide sandbox environment and validation tools for platform teams to test their service definitions
- **Documentation & Training**: Generate automated documentation and create training materials for platform team adoption

## Phase 6: Production Operations & Scaling (4-6 weeks)
- **Monitoring & Metrics**: Implement comprehensive monitoring with health checks, performance metrics, and alerting
- **Usage Analytics**: Build operational dashboard showing service utilization, success rates, and team adoption metrics
- **Performance Optimization**: Add caching, request queuing, and horizontal scaling to handle production load
- **Backup & Recovery**: Establish backup procedures for state data, configuration, and disaster recovery protocols
- **Production Deployment**: Deploy to production environment with proper CI/CD, security scanning, and rollback procedures

## Phase 7: Advanced Enterprise Features (6-8 weeks)
- **Service Dependencies**: Implement support for complex service dependencies and ordered provisioning workflows
- **Approval Workflows**: Add configurable approval steps for sensitive or high-cost resources with notification chains
- **Resource Quotas**: Implement quota management and enforcement across teams and environments
- **Multi-Environment Support**: Enable environment-aware provisioning with promotion pipelines (dev/test/prod)
- **Cost Integration**: Add cost estimation and tracking capabilities for provisioned resources with budget alerts

## Phase 8: Enterprise Integration & Governance (4-6 weeks)
- **CMDB Integration**: Connect with existing Configuration Management Database for asset tracking
- **ITSM Integration**: Seamless integration with existing IT Service Management tools beyond JIRA
- **Compliance Reporting**: Generate automated compliance reports for provisioned resources and access patterns
- **Multi-Tenant Support**: Enable isolation and governance for multiple business units with separate catalogs
- **Security Scanning**: Integrate with security tools for automatic vulnerability scanning of provisioned resources

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase Sequencing & Timeline
- **Total Duration**: 32-48 weeks (8-12 months)
- **Parallel Development**: Phases 2-3 can partially overlap after Phase 1 completion
- **Early Value**: Functional POC delivers value by week 6, production deployment by week 24
- **Seasonal Alignment**: Schedule Phase 6 (Production) deployment outside restricted change periods

### Success Metrics
- **Speed**: Reduce provisioning time from weeks to hours for automated services
- **Adoption**: Achieve 80% of platform teams onboarded with at least one automated service
- **Reliability**: Maintain 99.5% orchestrator uptime with <5 second response times
- **Scale**: Support 50+ concurrent requests without performance degradation

### Risk Mitigation
- **Incremental Rollout**: Start with read-only catalog, add fulfillment gradually
- **Rollback Strategy**: Implement comprehensive rollback before any production automation
- **Manual Fallback**: Maintain manual processes as backup for critical services
- **Change Management**: Align deployments with operational calendar and change windows

### Organizational Success Factors
- **Team Autonomy**: Platform teams maintain full ownership of their services and automation timeline
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Support manual-to-automated migration without forcing immediate change
- **Clear Value**: Demonstrate tangible time savings and improved developer experience early
- **Training & Support**: Provide comprehensive onboarding and ongoing support for platform teams
