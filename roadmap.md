## Team Coordination

### Team Distribution (6-8 Person Team)

**Catalog Team (2 people)**
- Owns catalog schema design and governance model
- GitHub repository setup with CI/CD and CODEOWNERS enforcement
- Catalog item creation, documentation, and platform team onboarding
- Schema validation rules and migration tools

**Service Team (3-4 people)**
- Core Service Sub-team (2 people): REST API, database, authentication, monitoring
- Fulfillment Sub-team (1-2 people): Action framework, variable system, external integrations
- Combined ownership of action types, circuit breakers, retry logic, and orchestration engine

**DevCtl Team (1-2 people)**
- Developer portal with dynamic form generation and request tracking
- CLI tools for catalog browsing, request submission, and automation
- API documentation, user experience, and platform team support
- Self-service tools and troubleshooting capabilities"

### Team Coordination Strategy

**Cross-Team Dependencies**:
- **Catalog â†’ Service**: Schema changes must be coordinated with API updates
- **Service â†’ DevCtl**: API changes require portal and CLI updates
- **Catalog â†’ DevCtl**: Schema presentation definitions drive form generation

**Quarterly Coordination**:
- **Sprint Planning**: All teams align on epic goals and interface contracts
- **Weekly Standups**: Cross-team integration issues and blockers
- **Sprint Demos**: End-to-end testing across all three repositories
- **Quarter End**: Epic completion validation and next quarter planning

**Integration Strategy**:
- Schema-first development ensures stable interfaces between teams
- Continuous integration testing across all repositories
- Feature flags enable independent deployment and testing"
