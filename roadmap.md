## Q3 2025: Foundation Epic ðŸš§ CURRENT (Aug-Oct)

**Epic Goal**: Establish working foundation with manual JIRA fulfillment

**Value Delivered**: Platform teams define services in the catalog, users request services, and fulfillment occurs through JIRA actions

**Success Metrics**:
- Developers can submit requests through DevCtl CLI and receive JIRA tickets with proper variable substitution
- Platform teams can define services using YAML catalog items with validation and governance
- All 19 Service API endpoints are operational and accessible via DevCtl commands

## Future Work Beyond Q4 2025

Potential areas for future platform evolution include multi-cloud support, enterprise marketplace, AI-powered automation, and advanced compliance frameworks.

**Future Problems (Not Addressed in Q3/Q4)**:
- Change management process for schema updates
- User feedback collection mechanism

---

## Proposals

### Database Schema Design Approach

**Proposal**: Use a hybrid approach combining structured tables for core request tracking with JSONB columns for flexible action configuration and user input data. This provides both query performance for status tracking and flexibility for diverse catalog item requirements.

**Rationale**: 
- Structured columns (request_id, status, created_at) enable efficient indexing and querying
- JSONB columns (request_data, action_config, error_context) provide schema flexibility
- PostgreSQL JSONB performance and indexing capabilities support complex queries when needed

### Error Handling Strategy Across Components

**Proposal**: Implement a three-tier error handling strategy:
1. **Component-Level**: Each component (Catalog, Service, DevCtl) handles its domain-specific errors with appropriate recovery
2. **Integration-Level**: Standardized error codes and correlation IDs for cross-component error tracking
3. **User-Level**: Consistent error formatting and actionable error messages across all interfaces

**Rationale**: 
- Enables independent component development while maintaining integration coherence
- Correlation IDs provide end-to-end traceability for debugging
- Standardized error codes enable DevCtl to provide intelligent error handling and suggestions

### Variable Substitution Implementation Approach

**Proposal**: Use a template engine with explicit scoping and validation phases:
1. **Parse Phase**: Extract all variable references and validate syntax
2. **Scope Resolution**: Validate all variables can be resolved within available scopes
3. **Substitution Phase**: Apply template engine with validated context data
4. **Post-Processing**: Apply transformation functions (upper, lower, concat, etc.)

**Rationale**:
- Pre-validation prevents runtime template failures
- Explicit scoping prevents accidental data leakage between contexts
- Transformation functions provide necessary flexibility for different action types
- Clear separation of concerns enables easier testing and debugging
