## Foundation Layer üèóÔ∏è **PRIORITY 1** - Repository Structure & Core Documents

**Goal**: Establish basic repository structure and essential documentation for platform teams to begin contributing

**Dependencies**: None - starting from empty repository

**Success Metrics**:
- Repository has clear structure with proper directory layout
- Essential documentation exists for platform teams to understand the project
- Git repository is properly configured with ignore patterns
- Platform teams understand what they're building and why

### Ordered Work Series

#### Repository Structure Creation
- **Foundation Work**: Create directory structure (`catalog/`, `bundles/`, `schema/`, `scripts/`, `templates/`, `tests/`)
- **Foundation Work**: Create `.gitignore` with appropriate patterns for YAML, JSON, Ruby, temp files
- **Foundation Work**: Create `README.md` explaining the catalog repository purpose and basic usage
- **Foundation Work**: Create `CONTRIBUTING.md` with guidelines for platform teams

**Rationale**: Platform teams need a clear structure before they can contribute. This establishes the contract for how the repository is organized.

---

## Schema & Validation Layer üìã **PRIORITY 2** - Schema Definitions & Validation Infrastructure

**Goal**: Define the contract for catalog items and bundles with robust validation

**Dependencies**: Foundation Layer must be complete

**Success Metrics**:
- JSON schemas exist for CatalogItem and CatalogBundle with all required fields
- Schema validation catches naming convention violations
- Variable syntax validation prevents template errors
- Cross-reference validation ensures bundle dependencies exist

### Ordered Work Series

#### Core Schema Development
- **Schema Work**: Create `schema/common-types.json` with shared field types, naming patterns, variable syntax
- **Schema Work**: Create `schema/catalog-item.json` with CatalogItem structure, required name field validation, form groups structure
- **Schema Work**: Create `schema/catalog-bundle.json` with CatalogBundle structure, component dependencies, sequential orchestration

#### Schema Validation Rules
- **Schema Work**: Implement naming convention validation (kebab-case IDs, camelCase fields, PascalCase kinds)
- **Schema Work**: Implement variable syntax validation (`{{.namespace.path.to.value}}`)
- **Schema Work**: Implement required field validation (name field with pattern `^[a-z][a-z0-9-]{2,28}[a-z0-9]$`)
- **Schema Work**: Implement cross-reference validation for bundle ‚Üí catalog item dependencies

#### Basic Validation Scripts
- **Validation Work**: Create `scripts/validate-schema.rb` for JSON Schema compliance checking
- **Validation Work**: Create `scripts/validate-naming.rb` for naming convention enforcement
- **Validation Work**: Create `scripts/validate-variables.rb` for variable syntax validation
- **Validation Work**: Create `scripts/validate-all.rb` as single entry point for all validations

**Rationale**: Schemas define the contract that everything else depends on. Without robust validation, we'll get inconsistent catalog items that break the system.

---

## Sample Content Layer üìù **PRIORITY 3** - Reference Implementations

**Goal**: Create working examples of catalog items for the three core service types

**Dependencies**: Schema & Validation Layer must be complete so samples can be validated

**Success Metrics**:
- Three complete catalog items exist: application (EKS), database (PostgreSQL), parameter store
- Each sample demonstrates different field types and complexity levels
- Samples include proper variable usage in JIRA ticket templates
- All samples pass schema validation

### Ordered Work Series

#### Template Development
- **Template Work**: Create `templates/catalog-item-template.yaml` with comprehensive field examples
- **Template Work**: Create `templates/jira-action-template.yaml` with variable substitution examples
- **Template Work**: Create `templates/catalog-bundle-template.yaml` for composite services

#### Core Sample Catalog Items
- **Sample Work**: Create `catalog/compute/eks-application.yaml` with form fields (appName, containerImage, replicas, instanceType)
- **Sample Work**: Create `catalog/databases/postgresql-standard.yaml` with form fields (instanceName, instanceClass, storageSize, backupRetention)
- **Sample Work**: Create `catalog/security/parameterstore-standard.yaml` with form fields (parameterName, parameterValue, description, encrypted)

#### Sample Bundle Creation
- **Sample Work**: Create `bundles/full-application-stack.yaml` combining EKS app + PostgreSQL + parameter store
- **Sample Work**: Demonstrate dependency relationships and variable passing between components

**Rationale**: Platform teams need concrete examples to understand how to create their own catalog items. These samples serve as both documentation and validation that our schemas work correctly.

---

## Testing & Quality Layer üß™ **PRIORITY 4** - Test Infrastructure & Continuous Integration

**Goal**: Ensure catalog quality through automated testing and validation

**Dependencies**: Sample Content Layer needed to have content to test against

**Success Metrics**:
- GitHub Actions validates all changes automatically
- Test fixtures exist for both valid and invalid scenarios
- Integration tests verify end-to-end variable substitution
- Pull request validation prevents broken catalog items from merging

### Ordered Work Series

#### Test Fixture Development
- **Test Work**: Create `tests/valid/` directory with examples of correct catalog items
- **Test Work**: Create `tests/invalid/` directory with examples that should fail validation
- **Test Work**: Create `tests/invalid/missing-required-fields.yaml` to test required field validation
- **Test Work**: Create `tests/invalid/invalid-naming-conventions.yaml` to test naming enforcement
- **Test Work**: Create `tests/invalid/malformed-variables.yaml` to test variable syntax validation

#### Advanced Validation Scripts
- **Validation Work**: Create `scripts/validate-changed.rb` to validate only modified files in PR
- **Validation Work**: Create `scripts/test-template.rb` to test variable substitution without external services
- **Validation Work**: Create `scripts/integration-test.rb` for end-to-end testing

#### GitHub Actions Workflow
- **CI Work**: Create `.github/workflows/validate-catalog.yml` with PR validation
- **CI Work**: Configure branch protection rules requiring validation to pass
- **CI Work**: Set up validation job that runs on push to main and all PRs
- **CI Work**: Configure job to run Ruby validation scripts and report results

**Rationale**: Without automated testing, catalog quality will degrade over time. This layer ensures that only valid, well-formed catalog items can be merged.

## Governance & Process Layer üèõÔ∏è **PRIORITY 5** - Team Ownership & Contribution Process

**Goal**: Establish governance model for platform teams to own and maintain their catalog categories

**Dependencies**: All previous layers must exist so governance can reference working examples

**Success Metrics**:
- CODEOWNERS enforces team ownership by category
- Platform teams have clear guidance on contributing catalog items
- Review process ensures quality while enabling team autonomy
- Documentation guides teams from idea to production catalog item

### Ordered Work Series

#### Ownership & Access Control
- **Governance Work**: Create `.github/CODEOWNERS` with team ownership by catalog category
- **Governance Work**: Configure required reviews for schema changes (requires platform architecture team)
- **Governance Work**: Document ownership model in README

#### Platform Team Guidance
- **Documentation Work**: Create `docs/platform-team-guide.md` with step-by-step contribution process
- **Documentation Work**: Create `docs/variable-guide.md` explaining the four variable namespaces and scoping rules
- **Documentation Work**: Create `docs/action-types.md` documenting JIRA ticket and future REST API actions
- **Documentation Work**: Create `docs/troubleshooting.md` for common validation errors and fixes

#### Quality & Review Process
- **Process Work**: Document pull request template for catalog item changes
- **Process Work**: Create review checklist for platform architecture team
- **Process Work**: Establish process for schema evolution and backward compatibility
- **Process Work**: Document process for testing catalog items before production deployment

**Rationale**: Governance ensures long-term maintainability and quality. Platform teams need clear guidance on how to contribute effectively while maintaining system integrity.
