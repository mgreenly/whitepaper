## Implementation Strategy

### Schema-First Development
Catalog schema design is the critical path - all service development depends on stable schema specification. Schema team leads with complete specification before service implementation begins.

### Binary Fulfillment Model
Services operate in either manual OR automated mode, never partial states. Platform teams can switch modes seamlessly based on automation maturity and operational requirements.

### Progressive Value Delivery
- **Q3 2025**: Manual fulfillment with automated JIRA tickets - immediate value for platform teams
- **Q4 2025**: Single service automation - hours instead of weeks for individual services
- **Q1 2026**: Multi-service orchestration - complete application stacks automated
- **Q2 2026**: Enterprise scale - 100% platform team adoption with enterprise features

### Epic-Based Coordination
- Each epic delivers working software that builds on previous capabilities
- Clear handoff points between epics with frozen interfaces and stable APIs
- Parallel work streams within epics to maximize team efficiency
- Epic completion criteria prevent scope creep and ensure quality gates

### Operational Calendar Alignment
- Q3 2025: Foundation work during normal operational period
- Q4 2025: Integration work during restricted change period (no major deployments)
- Q1 2026: First production deployment after restricted period ends
- Q2 2026: Enterprise rollout during stable operational period

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risk Mitigation

**Schema Design Risks**:
- Risk: Schema changes breaking existing services
- Mitigation: Version management, backward compatibility, and migration tools

**External Service Dependencies**:
- Risk: JIRA, GitHub, AWS service failures blocking automation
- Mitigation: Circuit breakers, automatic fallback to manual mode, comprehensive retry logic

**Performance and Scale**:
- Risk: System cannot handle concurrent requests or large catalogs
- Mitigation: Redis caching, database optimization, load testing, and horizontal scaling

**Security and Compliance**:
- Risk: Security vulnerabilities or compliance failures
- Mitigation: Automated security scanning, audit logging, AWS IAM integration, and compliance frameworks

### Organizational Risk Mitigation

**Platform Team Adoption**:
- Risk: Teams resist change or don't adopt new processes
- Mitigation: Progressive onboarding, training programs, clear value demonstration, and opt-in approach

**Operational Calendar Constraints**:
- Risk: Restricted change periods limiting deployment opportunities
- Mitigation: Epic timing aligned with operational calendar, focus on foundation work during restricted periods

**Team Coordination**:
- Risk: 6-8 person team blocking each other or duplicating work
- Mitigation: Clear work stream boundaries, epic handoff procedures, and parallel development paths

**Scope Creep**:
- Risk: Feature requests expanding beyond epic boundaries
- Mitigation: Epic completion criteria, clear success metrics, and progressive enhancement model
