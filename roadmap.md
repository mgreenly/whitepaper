## Current Timeline: Late Q3 2025

Project starting now (late Q3 2025) to develop the Platform Automation Orchestrator (PAO) that transforms multi-week provisioning into self-service automation. The core vision is a document-driven convergence point where platform teams define services in YAML documents that generate both UI forms and automation workflows.

## Strategic Context

**Problem**: Fragmented provisioning process requiring multiple JIRA tickets across platform teams, creating 2-3 week delays
**Solution**: Central document store where platform teams define services enabling binary fulfillment (manual JIRA OR automated)
**Goal**: Reduce provisioning time from weeks to hours (90%+ improvement) while respecting operational constraints

## Development Phases

### Q3 2025: Foundation Setup ðŸš§ STARTING NOW
- **Repository Setup**: Create GitHub repositories for catalog and service with CI/CD workflows and basic documentation
- **Infrastructure**: Deploy basic Kubernetes infrastructure and empty REST service with health endpoints  
- **Schema Design**: Define Schema v2.0 specification for catalog items with validation rules
- **Document Store**: Implement basic YAML catalog ingestion with file-based storage and validation
- **JIRA Integration**: Create automated JIRA ticket creation with basic variable substitution for manual fulfillment

### Q4 2025: Core Orchestration ðŸ“‹ PLANNED
- **API Expansion**: Build comprehensive REST endpoints for catalog browsing, request submission, and status tracking
- **Form Generation**: Transform catalog presentation definitions into dynamic JSON schemas for UI rendering
- **Variable System**: Implement advanced templating with user context, metadata, system variables, and functions
- **Request Lifecycle**: Deploy complete workflow with state tracking from submission to completion
- **Action Framework**: Implement core action types (REST API, Terraform, GitHub workflows) beyond basic JIRA

### 2026+: Enterprise Features ðŸ”® FUTURE WORK
- **State Persistence**: Deploy PostgreSQL for request state and resource tracking with Redis caching layer
- **Reliability**: Add circuit breakers, retry logic, rollback capabilities, and comprehensive error handling
- **Monitoring**: Implement Prometheus metrics, structured logging, distributed tracing, and alerting
- **Authentication**: Deploy IAM-based authentication with comprehensive RBAC and team-based access control
- **Platform Onboarding**: Create templates and migration tools for all platform teams
- **Enterprise Integration**: CMDB integration, ITSM tools, compliance frameworks, approval workflows

## Success Metrics

**Q3 2025 Goals**:
- GitHub repositories established with CI/CD workflows and basic documentation
- Kubernetes infrastructure deployed with health endpoints operational
- Schema v2.0 specification defined with basic validation rules
- First catalog item defined and validated successfully
- Basic JIRA integration working for manual fulfillment

**Q4 2025 Goals**:
- Catalog API operational with <200ms response time for browsing services
- Dynamic form generation working for 5+ field types with validation
- Request lifecycle tracking operational from submission to completion
- 3+ action types implemented (JIRA, REST API, Terraform) with variable substitution
- First automated service provisioned end-to-end with <4 hour fulfillment

**2026 Goals**:
- 100% platform team adoption with multiple services onboarded
- 90%+ provisioning time reduction from weeks to hours
- Production deployment with 99.9% uptime and enterprise security

## Implementation Strategy

### Binary Fulfillment Model
Platform teams start with manual JIRA fulfillment, then evolve to full automation at their own pace. Services operate in either manual OR automated mode, never partial states.

### Progressive Enhancement
- **Phase 1**: Teams define catalog items with presentation and manual JIRA fulfillment
- **Phase 2**: Teams add automated actions while keeping manual fallback
- **Phase 3**: Teams choose binary fulfillment mode based on automation maturity

### Change Management
- Respect Sept-Jan restricted change periods for major deployments
- Maintain existing JIRA processes as backup throughout rollout
- Enable platform team autonomy over automation timeline
- Focus on incremental value delivery aligned with business rhythms

## Risk Mitigation

**Technical Risks**:
- External service dependencies mitigated by circuit breakers and manual fallback
- Performance bottlenecks addressed through Redis caching and database optimization
- Security vulnerabilities prevented by automated scanning and dependency updates

**Organizational Risks**:
- Platform team resistance minimized through progressive onboarding and training
- Operational calendar constraints respected with deployment timing outside restricted periods
- Change management aligned with existing governance workflows and approval processes
