# Platform Automation Orchestrator Development Roadmap

## Executive Summary

This roadmap transforms our fragmented, multi-week provisioning process into a comprehensive, enterprise-grade self-service platform through the Platform Automation Orchestrator (PAO). Operating as a cloud-native REST API within the Integration and Delivery Plane, PAO orchestrates the complete service lifecycle through a sophisticated document-driven architecture, delivering measurable business value while enabling progressive automation across all platform domains.
