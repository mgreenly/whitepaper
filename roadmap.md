## Implementation Strategy

### Binary Fulfillment Model
Platform teams start with manual JIRA fulfillment, then evolve to full automation at their own pace. Services operate in either manual OR automated mode, never partial states.

### Progressive Enhancement
- **Phase 1**: Teams define catalog items with presentation and manual JIRA fulfillment
- **Phase 2**: Teams add automated actions while keeping manual fallback  
- **Phase 3**: Multi-service orchestration with cross-service dependencies (Q4 2025 focus)
- **Phase 4**: Teams choose binary fulfillment mode based on automation maturity

### Change Management
- Respect Sept-Jan restricted change periods for major deployments
- Maintain existing JIRA processes as backup throughout rollout
- Enable platform team autonomy over automation timeline
- Focus on incremental value delivery aligned with business rhythms

## Risk Mitigation

**Technical Risks**:
- External service dependencies mitigated by circuit breakers and manual fallback
- Performance bottlenecks addressed through Redis caching and database optimization
- Security vulnerabilities prevented by automated scanning and dependency updates

**Organizational Risks**:
- Platform team resistance minimized through progressive onboarding and training
- Operational calendar constraints respected with deployment timing outside restricted periods
- Change management aligned with existing governance workflows and approval processes
