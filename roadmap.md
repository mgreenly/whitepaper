# IDP Orchestrator Development Roadmap

## Phase 1: Foundation & Discovery
- **Requirements Analysis**: Define what the orchestrator needs to accomplish, identify key stakeholders and use cases
- **Architecture Vision**: Establish high-level system design principles and integration patterns with existing developer workflows

## Phase 2: Technical Foundation  
- **Technology Stack Selection**: Choose core technologies, frameworks, and infrastructure components that align with scalability and maintainability goals
- **Project Scaffolding**: Set up development environment, repository structure, and basic CI/CD pipeline

## Phase 3: Core Design
- **API Design**: Define the primary interfaces and contracts the orchestrator will expose to other IDP components
- **Data Model**: Establish how the orchestrator will store and manage state, configurations, and workflow definitions

## Phase 4: MVP Implementation
