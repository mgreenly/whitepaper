## Current Timeline: Early Q3 2025

Project starting now (early Q3 2025) to develop the Platform Automation Orchestrator (PAO) that transforms multi-week provisioning into self-service automation. The core vision is a document-driven convergence point where platform teams define services in YAML documents that generate both UI forms and automation workflows.

## Strategic Context

**Problem**: Fragmented provisioning process requiring multiple JIRA tickets across platform teams, creating 2-3 week delays
**Solution**: Central document store where platform teams define services enabling binary fulfillment (manual JIRA OR automated)
**Goal**: Reduce provisioning time from weeks to hours (90%+ improvement) while respecting operational constraints

## Development Phases

### Q3 2025: Foundation Setup ðŸš§ CURRENT (Aug-Oct)
- **Repository Setup**: Create GitHub repositories for catalog and service with CI/CD workflows and basic documentation
- **Infrastructure**: Deploy basic Kubernetes infrastructure and empty REST service with health endpoints  
- **Schema Design**: Define Schema v2.0 specification for catalog items with validation rules
- **Document Store**: Implement basic YAML catalog ingestion with file-based storage and validation
- **JIRA Integration**: Create automated JIRA ticket creation with basic variable substitution for manual fulfillment

### Q4 2025: Complete Stack Provisioning ðŸ“‹ PLANNED (Nov-Jan)
**Goal**: Enable end-to-end provisioning of EKS container app with database and secrets management

- **Multi-Service Orchestration**: Coordinate provisioning across compute, database, and security services in correct dependency order
- **EKS Container Support**: Implement Terraform actions for EKS cluster, node groups, ingress, and application deployment
- **Database Integration**: Add RDS PostgreSQL provisioning with connection string generation and security group setup
- **Secrets Management**: Integrate AWS Secrets Manager with automatic secret creation, rotation, and injection into applications
- **Complex Variable System**: Support cross-service variable passing (database connection strings to app configs, generated secrets to deployments)
- **Dependency Management**: Ensure proper sequencing (VPC â†’ Database â†’ Secrets â†’ EKS â†’ App Deployment)

### 2026+: Enterprise Features ðŸ”® FUTURE WORK
- **State Persistence**: Deploy PostgreSQL for request state and resource tracking with Redis caching layer
- **Reliability**: Add circuit breakers, retry logic, rollback capabilities, and comprehensive error handling
- **Monitoring**: Implement Prometheus metrics, structured logging, distributed tracing, and alerting
- **Authentication**: Deploy IAM-based authentication with comprehensive RBAC and team-based access control
- **Platform Onboarding**: Create templates and migration tools for all platform teams
- **Enterprise Integration**: CMDB integration, ITSM tools, compliance frameworks, approval workflows

## Success Metrics

**Q3 2025 Goals**:
- GitHub repositories established with CI/CD workflows and basic documentation
- Kubernetes infrastructure deployed with health endpoints operational
- Schema v2.0 specification defined with basic validation rules
- First catalog item defined and validated successfully
- Basic JIRA integration working for manual fulfillment

**Q4 2025 Goals**:
- **Complete Stack Demo**: Successfully provision EKS app + PostgreSQL + secrets end-to-end in <4 hours
- **Multi-Service Coordination**: Support 3+ services with cross-service variable passing (DB credentials â†’ app config)
- **Advanced Terraform Actions**: EKS cluster, RDS database, security groups, ingress, application deployment
- **Secrets Integration**: AWS Secrets Manager integration with automatic injection into Kubernetes deployments
- **Configuration Complexity**: Handle typical production options (instance sizes, storage, networking, monitoring, backup schedules)
- **Dependency Orchestration**: Proper sequencing of VPC â†’ Database â†’ Secrets â†’ EKS â†’ Application deployment

**2026 Goals**:
- 100% platform team adoption with multiple services onboarded
- 90%+ provisioning time reduction from weeks to hours
- Production deployment with 99.9% uptime and enterprise security

## Q4 2025 Target: Complete EKS Stack Example

**User Request**: "Deploy my Node.js app on EKS with PostgreSQL database and proper secrets management"

**Expected Configuration Options**:
- **Application**: Container image, replicas, resource limits, health checks, environment variables
- **EKS Cluster**: Node instance types, autoscaling groups, Kubernetes version, networking configuration
- **Database**: RDS instance class, storage size, backup retention, maintenance windows, encryption
- **Secrets**: Database credentials, API keys, TLS certificates with automatic rotation
- **Networking**: VPC setup, security groups, ingress rules, load balancer configuration
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch integration, log aggregation, alerting thresholds

**Orchestration Flow**:
1. Provision VPC and networking components
2. Create RDS PostgreSQL instance with generated credentials
3. Store database credentials in AWS Secrets Manager
4. Provision EKS cluster with worker nodes
5. Deploy application with secrets injected as environment variables
6. Configure ingress and monitoring

## Implementation Strategy

### Binary Fulfillment Model
Platform teams start with manual JIRA fulfillment, then evolve to full automation at their own pace. Services operate in either manual OR automated mode, never partial states.

### Progressive Enhancement
- **Phase 1**: Teams define catalog items with presentation and manual JIRA fulfillment
- **Phase 2**: Teams add automated actions while keeping manual fallback  
- **Phase 3**: Multi-service orchestration with cross-service dependencies (Q4 2025 focus)
- **Phase 4**: Teams choose binary fulfillment mode based on automation maturity

### Change Management
- Respect Sept-Jan restricted change periods for major deployments
- Maintain existing JIRA processes as backup throughout rollout
- Enable platform team autonomy over automation timeline
- Focus on incremental value delivery aligned with business rhythms

## Risk Mitigation

**Technical Risks**:
- External service dependencies mitigated by circuit breakers and manual fallback
- Performance bottlenecks addressed through Redis caching and database optimization
- Security vulnerabilities prevented by automated scanning and dependency updates

**Organizational Risks**:
- Platform team resistance minimized through progressive onboarding and training
- Operational calendar constraints respected with deployment timing outside restricted periods
- Change management aligned with existing governance workflows and approval processes
