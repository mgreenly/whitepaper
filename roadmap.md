# IDP Orchestrator Development Roadmap

## Phase 1: Foundation & Architecture
- **Reference Architecture Documentation**: Formalize the five-plane architecture (Developer Control, Integration/Delivery, Security/Compliance, Monitoring/Logging, Resource)
- **Orchestrator Catalog Repository Setup**: Create GitHub repository to serve as central document store for CatalogItem definitions
- **CatalogItem Schema Design**: Define comprehensive schema supporting presentation fields, fulfillment actions, and metadata sections
- **Initial Action Types**: Implement support for JIRA ticket creation, REST API calls, Terraform generation, GitHub workflows, and webhooks
- **Schema Validation Framework**: Create validation rules, JSON schemas, and automated testing for CatalogItem documents

## Phase 2: Core Orchestration Engine
- **API Framework Setup**: Establish REST API service with OpenAPI specification for developer portal consumption
- **Database Design**: Configure SQL database for state management, request tracking, and audit logging
- **Catalog Processing Engine**: Implement logic to consume, validate, and transform CatalogItem documents into unified service catalog
- **Action Execution Engine**: Build modular execution framework for all supported action types with retry and error handling
- **Webhook Integration**: Implement GitHub webhook endpoint for real-time catalog synchronization

## Phase 3: State Management & Lifecycle
- **Resource State Tracking**: Build Terraform-inspired state management system for provisioned resources
- **Request Lifecycle Management**: Implement request tracking from submission through fulfillment completion
- **State Reconciliation**: Create verification engine to ensure actual resource state matches recorded state
- **Rollback Capabilities**: Implement rollback mechanisms for failed or unwanted provisioning actions
- **Change Detection**: Build system to detect and reconcile drift between desired and actual state

## Phase 4: Developer Experience Integration
- **Portal API Endpoints**: Create comprehensive REST API for developer portal integration including catalog browsing, request submission, and status tracking
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Implement security layer with RBAC and integration to existing identity systems
- **Request Validation**: Build client-side and server-side validation using CatalogItem presentation schemas
- **Real-time Status Updates**: Implement WebSocket or SSE for live request status updates in developer portal
- **Audit Trail**: Create comprehensive logging and audit capabilities for compliance and troubleshooting

## Phase 5: Platform Team Onboarding
- **Multi-Platform Support**: Create standardized integration patterns for compute, database, messaging, networking, storage, security, and monitoring teams
- **Migration Tools**: Build utilities to help platform teams convert existing manual processes into CatalogItem definitions
- **Testing Framework**: Provide testing tools for platform teams to validate their CatalogItem definitions
- **Documentation Generation**: Automatically generate documentation from CatalogItem schemas for platform team reference
- **Progressive Enhancement Support**: Enable seamless transition from manual JIRA fulfillment to full automation

## Phase 6: Observability & Operations
- **Monitoring Integration**: Implement metrics collection and alerting for orchestrator health and performance
- **Usage Analytics**: Build dashboard showing service utilization, fulfillment success rates, and performance metrics
- **Error Handling & Recovery**: Create comprehensive error handling with automatic retry logic and human escalation paths
- **Performance Optimization**: Implement caching, request queuing, and horizontal scaling capabilities
- **Backup & Disaster Recovery**: Establish backup procedures for state data and catalog repository

## Phase 7: Advanced Features & Scaling
- **Service Dependencies**: Implement support for complex service dependencies and ordered provisioning
- **Approval Workflows**: Add optional approval steps for sensitive or high-cost resources
- **Resource Quotas**: Implement quota management and enforcement across teams and environments
- **Multi-Environment Support**: Enable environment-aware provisioning with promotion pipelines
- **Cost Tracking**: Integrate cost estimation and tracking for provisioned resources

## Phase 8: Enterprise Integration
- **CMDB Integration**: Connect with existing Configuration Management Database systems
- **ITSM Integration**: Seamless integration with existing IT Service Management tools beyond JIRA
- **Compliance Reporting**: Generate compliance reports for provisioned resources and access patterns
- **Multi-Tenant Support**: Enable isolation and governance for multiple business units or teams
- **API Gateway Integration**: Connect with existing API management infrastructure for secure external access

## Implementation Notes

### Success Metrics
- Reduce average provisioning time from weeks to hours
- Achieve 95% automation rate for common platform services
- Maintain 99.9% orchestrator uptime
- Support 100+ concurrent requests without performance degradation

### Risk Mitigation
- Start with read-only catalog integration before implementing fulfillment
- Implement comprehensive rollback mechanisms before production deployment
- Maintain manual override capabilities for critical situations
- Establish clear escalation paths for automation failures

### Organizational Alignment
- Respect existing team ownership and processes during transition
- Provide clear migration paths without forcing immediate automation
- Align with operational calendar constraints and change management policies
- Focus on incremental value delivery over disruptive transformation
