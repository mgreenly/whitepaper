# Platform Automation Orchestrator Development Roadmap

## Executive Summary

This roadmap transforms our fragmented, multi-week provisioning process into a streamlined, self-service platform through the Platform Automation Orchestrator (PAO). Operating as a stateless REST API within the Integration and Delivery Plane, PAO orchestrates the entire service lifecycle from catalog presentation through automated fulfillment, delivering measurable business value while respecting organizational constraints and enabling progressive automation.

## Strategic Context & Technical Foundation

**Current Challenge**: Multi-week provisioning delays caused by fragmented manual handoffs across platform teams requiring multiple JIRA tickets  
**Solution**: Document-driven convergence point where platform teams define services through structured YAML documents enabling dual-purpose catalog and fulfillment automation  
**Business Value**: Reduce provisioning time from weeks to hours (90%+ improvement) while maintaining team autonomy and operational stability  
**Constraints**: Sept-Jan restricted change periods, existing organizational structure, enterprise security and compliance requirements

**Technical Architecture**: Stateless, horizontally-scalable REST service with comprehensive API (15+ endpoints), multi-action fulfillment engine, and enterprise-grade security framework

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation & Reference Architecture (4-6 weeks)
**Business Value**: Establish shared understanding and organizational alignment
