## Q3 2025: Foundation Epic ðŸš§ CURRENT (Aug-Oct)

**Epic Goal**: Establish working foundation with manual JIRA fulfillment

**Value Delivered**: Platform teams define services in the catalog, users request services, and fulfillment occurs through JIRA actions

**Success Metrics**:
- Schema specification complete with 100% validation coverage
- Core REST API deployed with <200ms response times and JIRA action type
- Test catalog items working: EKS app, PostgreSQL database, parameter store (all JIRA fulfillment)
- Developers can submit requests and receive JIRA tickets with proper variable substitution

### Catalog Focus
- Complete CatalogItem schema specification with validation rules
- GitHub repository with CI/CD, CODEOWNERS enforcement, automated validation
- Test catalog items: EKS app, PostgreSQL database, parameter store (all JIRA fulfillment)
- Governance model and platform team contribution workflows

**Catalog Repository Files to Create**:
- `.github/CODEOWNERS`
- `.github/workflows/validate-catalog.yml`
- `schema/catalog-item-v2.json`
- `schema/catalog-bundle-v2.json`
- `schema/common-types.json`
- `scripts/validate-catalog.sh`
- `scripts/validate-all.sh`
- `scripts/test-template.sh`
- `scripts/validate-changed.sh`
- `scripts/integration-test.sh`
- `tests/valid/example-catalog-item.yaml`
- `tests/invalid/missing-required-fields.yaml`
- `tests/invalid/invalid-naming-conventions.yaml`
- `templates/catalog-item-template.yaml`
- `templates/jira-action-template.yaml`
- `catalog/compute/eks-containerapp.yaml`
- `catalog/databases/postgresql-standard.yaml`
- `catalog/security/parameterstore-standard.yaml`
- `README.md`
- `.gitignore`

### Service Focus
- Core REST API with catalog ingestion, request submission, status tracking
- JIRA action execution framework with variable substitution
- Variable substitution system supporting 6+ scopes (fields, metadata, request, system, environment, outputs)
- PostgreSQL database schema for requests and audit logging

**Required API Endpoints (17 total)**:

*Core User Journey (16 endpoints)*:
- `/api/v1/catalog` - Browse available services
- `/api/v1/catalog/items/{item_id}` - Service details
- `/api/v1/catalog/items/{item_id}/schema` - Dynamic form schema
- `/api/v1/validate/request` - Validate user input before submission
- `/api/v1/requests` - Submit/list service requests
- `/api/v1/requests/{request_id}` - Request details
- `/api/v1/requests/{request_id}/status` - Current status
- `/api/v1/requests/{request_id}/logs` - Execution logs
- `/api/v1/requests/{request_id}/retry` - Retry failed action
- `/api/v1/requests/{request_id}/abort` - Abort failed request
- `/api/v1/requests/{request_id}/escalate` - Escalate to manual support
- `/api/v1/requests/{request_id}/escalation` - Escalation details
- `/api/v1/catalog/refresh` - Force catalog refresh
- `/api/v1/health` - Service health status
- `/api/v1/health/ready` - Readiness probe
- `/api/v1/version` - Service version info

*Platform Team Tools (3 endpoints)*:
- `/api/v1/validate/catalog-item` - Validate service definition
- `/api/v1/preview/form` - Preview form generation
- `/api/v1/test/variables` - Test variable substitution

*System Integration (1 endpoint)*:
- `/api/v1/metrics` - Prometheus metrics

**Service Implementation Tasks**:
1. **Core Infrastructure Setup**
   - PostgreSQL database schema (requests, request_actions tables)
   - Redis caching layer integration
   - AWS Lambda deployment framework
   - Environment configuration and secrets management

2. **Catalog Management Implementation** 
   - GitHub webhook processing for catalog updates
   - Catalog item parsing and validation
   - Schema-to-form generation logic
   - Catalog refresh and caching mechanisms

3. **Request Lifecycle Engine**
   - Request submission and validation pipeline
   - Status tracking and state management
   - Request queuing and processing architecture
   - Audit logging and correlation IDs

4. **JIRA Action Framework**
   - JIRA API integration with authentication
   - Variable substitution engine (6+ scopes)
   - Template processing and ticket creation
   - Status polling and webhook handling

5. **Error Handling and Recovery**
   - Circuit breaker implementation for external calls
   - Retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Failure context preservation
   - Manual escalation workflow

6. **API Endpoint Implementation**
   - All 20 REST endpoints with proper error handling
   - Request validation and response formatting
   - Pagination support for list endpoints
   - Health checks and metrics export

### DevCtl Focus
**Lock-Step Development**: DevCtl must deliver CLI support for ALL Q3 Service and Catalog features simultaneously

- CLI commands for all 20 Service API endpoints (catalog browsing, request operations, health checks, platform team tools)
- Dynamic form generation and request submission with real-time validation
- Request tracking with status monitoring and log streaming capabilities
- AWS IAM authentication integration with SigV4 signing
- Platform team validation tools (catalog-item validation, form preview, variable testing)
- Integration testing capabilities for Service API verification

**Epic Success Criteria**: Developers can request EKS app + PostgreSQL + parameter store through CLI and receive JIRA tickets with proper variable substitution. All Service API endpoints are accessible and testable via DevCtl commands.

## Q4 2025: Production Epic ðŸ“‹ PLANNED (Nov-Jan)

**Epic Goal**: Add automated fulfillment to proven manual workflows

**Value Delivered**: Developers can request services and receive automated provisioning (Terraform, REST API) while platform teams maintain manual fallback

**Success Metrics**:
- Production AWS deployment with monitoring, alerting, and high availability
- Test catalog items enhanced with automated actions (Terraform, REST API)
- Fulfillment mode switching operational (manual â†” automated)
- Automated provisioning working for EKS app, PostgreSQL, parameter store
- 5+ platform teams can define services with automated and manual fulfillment options

### Catalog Focus
- Enhanced schema supporting Terraform action types with repository mapping
- 10+ production-ready catalog items for compute, database, storage, networking
- Platform team migration tools and training materials
- Complex variable templating patterns with secrets and outputs scope

### Service Focus
- Terraform action type with infrastructure provisioning capabilities
- Production AWS deployment with RDS, Redis, monitoring, alerting
- Fulfillment mode switching (seamless manual â†” automated switching)
- Performance optimization supporting 100+ concurrent requests

### DevCtl Focus
**Lock-Step Development**: DevCtl must deliver CLI support for ALL Q4 Service enhancements simultaneously

- Advanced CLI features for Terraform action tracking, logs, and automated fulfillment monitoring
- Batch operations and CI/CD integration capabilities for automated provisioning workflows
- Enhanced platform team tools supporting automated action testing and troubleshooting
- Production-ready CLI with comprehensive error handling and recovery operations
- Advanced authentication and authorization features matching Service capabilities
- Performance monitoring and metrics collection CLI commands

**Epic Success Criteria**: Production platform with automated provisioning significantly reducing service delivery time and 5+ platform teams onboarded. All automated fulfillment capabilities are manageable and monitorable via DevCtl.
