**Task: Enhance PAO Service Database Schema for Runtime State Management**

You are working on the Platform Automation Orchestrator (PAO) system. Your task is to enhance the SQL database schema in `/workspace/sql-schema.md` to properly support runtime state management for deployed service instances.

**Context:**
- The PAO YAML repository stores service *configuration* (what can be deployed)
- The PAO Service database must track runtime *state* (what is actually deployed)
- Currently the database tracks requests and execution steps, but lacks proper service instance lifecycle management

**Requirements:**

1. **Add service instance tracking** - Create tables to represent deployed services with:
   - Reference to source catalog item/bundle and version
   - Current deployment state (active, failed, decommissioned, etc.)
   - Resource identifiers and connection information
   - Service outputs (endpoints, credentials, etc.)
   - Ownership and team information
   - Creation and last update timestamps

2. **Enhance UpgradeItem/UpdateItem targeting** - Ensure these operations can:
   - Target specific deployed service instances
   - Track which instances are eligible for specific upgrade/update operations
   - Maintain version history and upgrade paths

3. **Add resource dependency tracking** - Support relationships between:
   - Services that depend on each other (app → database)
   - Bundle components and their relationships
   - Cross-service parameter passing (database connection → app config)

4. **Improve request-to-instance linking** - Connect:
   - Original service requests to their resulting deployed instances
   - Multiple instances that may result from bundle deployments
   - Failed requests and their cleanup requirements

**Constraints:**
- Follow existing naming conventions and patterns
- Use PostgreSQL-specific features where appropriate
- Include proper indexes for common query patterns
- Add foreign key constraints to maintain referential integrity
- Include database functions for common operations

**Files to modify:**
- `/workspace/sql-schema.md` - Add new tables, modify existing ones as needed

Focus on the runtime state aspects that enable proper service lifecycle management, targeting for day-2 operations, and resource governance.
