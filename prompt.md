Introduction
============

You are both a business and technical expert in Internal Developer Platforms.

Our goal is to create business whitepaper outlining an approach to building an internal developer platform.

The result should be close to 1,000 words.

## Background

The orgs currently has no real unified developer portal experience. Instead if facilities this work through JIRA where teams are required to submit many tickets to the many different platform teams; compute, storage, messaging, networking, etc... to create a new app.  This often takes 3-7 weeks to provision an application.

The org has made multiple attempts in recent years to modernize its offering through large re-org big bang style initiatives that have failed. There are some Sr. Directors that have began to believe buying a solution from an external vendor is the correct path.  Hannah and I think that this is a failure path for a number of reasons, including;
  * The orgs current structure does not lend it's self to a modern IDP structure.  The components of the IDP would live under the pervue of at least 7 Sr. Directors all reporting to the same Sr. Vice President
  * The org has a very important holiday cycle where code freezes prevent any major platform changes between august and February.  This makes any kind of big-bing change super difficult.  All existing resources need to remain focused on keeping the existing platform running in that freeze period so they tend to resist changes to support any new effort meant to replace them, intentionally or not.

## Prior Attempts

This is NOT our first attempt at writing this document.

We're taking an iterative approach at it's development.

In our first attempt you read these documents

  - @docs/terms.md                - Dictionary of acronyms and definitions.
  - @docs/the-org.md              - Information about the org's structure and people.
  - @docs/psa-spec.md             - Overview of the proposed PSA solution.

We also provided the first two drafts of the white paper

  - @whitepaper-01.md
  - @whitepaper-02.md

We also provided you this guidance


    > Hannah and I would like to propose a much more progressive approach that stays focused on satisfying the customer needs that doesn't rely upon a restructure of the org.  Keeping that customers for us are internal developer teams.
    >
    > The core idea of our orchestration solution is that we use a centralized Github repo to coordinate the offerings of all the platforms teams.  Each team would define it's offering in a Json document.  This document would both indicate what questions have to be answered by the customer to request it and how that request gets forwarded to the specific platform team offering it.  The orchestration solution provides a uniform interface to the developer portal to present the catalog of offerings to customers.  The same JSON document provides the necessary information for the orchestration software to dispatch the request to the correct platform team.
    >
    > The final document will be a word document that ideally should be 8 pages or less structore the content to be appropriate for that format.
    >
    > Do not incldue execssive technical detail in the final white paper.  The docs/psa-spec.md can provide that seperately and that doc can be referenced by name if useful.
    >
    > Never reference competitors, instead focus on lost opportunity.
    >
    >  * Do not use individual names in the end product.
    >  * You can use Michael Greenly and Hannah Stone for attribution.
    >  * Do NOT use the name Humanitec.
    >  * Do NOT use the term re-org.
    >  * Do NOT use the term big-bang.
    >  * DO focus on the context that's changed since the last iteration.
    >  * DO include citations to the sources of data.
    >  * DO NOT read any documents other than those you were directory asked to.

And then you produced:

  - @whitepaper-03.md

Then we provided the followoing feedback:

  >  I like the title "Accelerating Innovation Through Platform Solutions Automation"
  >
  >  1. Introduce the Reference Architecture:
  >      * Integrate the concept of a "Reference Architecture" as a foundational framework for the proposed Internal Developer Platform (IDP).
  >      * Explain that this architecture is intentionally opinionated to prevent unnecessary complexity and ensure that all components are aligned with best practices.
  >      * Emphasize that this approach avoids redundant or misaligned additions, focusing on a streamlined and effective platform.
  >
  >  2. Highlight the Platform Orchestrator:
  >      * Within the "Integration and Delivery Plane" of the architecture, specifically spotlight the "Platform Orchestrator" as a critical capability.
  >      * Clearly connect the Platform Orchestrator to the Platform Solutions Automation (PSA), explaining that the PSA is the core technology that enables this orchestration.
  >
  >  3. Strengthen the Recommendation:
  >      * Position the whitepaper's recommendation as a confident, authoritative proposal that is firmly grounded in established Reference Architecture principles.
  >      * The tone should be decisive and clear, leaving no room for ambiguity.
  >
  >  4. Address Counter-Arguments Subtly:
  >      * Without being confrontational, subtly counter the tendency to add unnecessary components ("boxes or planes") to the architecture.
  >      * Highlight the risks of such additions, such as fragmentation, increased complexity, and diluted value.
  >      * Reinforce the benefits of a focused, value-driven design that prioritizes efficiency and developer experience.
  >
  >  5. Execution:
  >      * Maintain the existing flow and structure of the whitepaper.
  >      * The new concepts and language should be woven into the existing narrative to feel like a natural and integral part of the document's argument.

And then you produced:

  - @whitepaper-04.md

Where's some new feeback:


Actions
=======
  * increment the numeric value in the ./.count file by +1
  * If you are Google Gemini read the current version of ./whitepaper-gemini.md
  * Analyze all the provided context and synthesize it into a professionally structure whitepaper and write it to whitepaper-05.md
