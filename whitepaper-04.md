# Accelerating Innovation Through Platform Solutions Automation

**Authors:** Hannah Stone and Michael Greenly
**Version:** 14

## 1. Executive Summary

Our organization's capacity for innovation is directly constrained by the speed at which our development teams can deliver new applications. Currently, a fragmented and manual provisioning process creates significant friction, forcing teams to wait 3-7 weeks for essential resources. This delay translates to lost opportunity and a diminished competitive edge.

This paper presents a decisive path forward. We recommend the adoption of an opinionated **Reference Architecture** as the foundational framework for our Internal Developer Platform (IDP). This architecture will guide the implementation of a central **Platform Orchestrator**, a critical capability powered by **Platform Solutions Automation (PSA)**.

This approach will empower our developers with a modern, self-service portal, drastically reducing provisioning times and enabling rapid, iterative development. This is not a proposal for a disruptive overhaul but a confident, value-driven strategy that works within our existing organizational structure to unlock our engineering teams' full potential.

## 2. The Challenge: A Fragmented Developer Experience

Our current developer experience is characterized by fragmentation and manual handoffs. To provision a new application, a development team must navigate a complex process of submitting multiple JIRA tickets to various platform teams, including compute, storage, messaging, and networking. This multi-team dependency chain is the primary contributor to the 3-7 week lead time for new projects.

This lengthy cycle creates a significant drag on innovation. Furthermore, our organization's operational calendar, which includes a critical code freeze between August and February to protect holiday season stability, makes large-scale, disruptive technology initiatives impractical. Past attempts at sweeping modernization have struggled against these realities. The path forward must respect these constraints, focusing on incremental value delivery that aligns with, rather than disrupts, our core business rhythms.

## 3. A Foundational Framework: The Reference Architecture

To ensure a coherent and sustainable evolution of our developer platform, we must ground our efforts in a formal **Reference Architecture**. This architecture provides an intentionally opinionated, best-practice framework for our Internal Developer Platform (IDP), defining its core components—or "planes"—and how they interact. The five key planes are:

1.  **Developer Control Plane:** The interface for developers (e.g., the Dev Portal, Git).
2.  **Integration and Delivery Plane:** The engine for CI/CD and automation.
3.  **Security and Compliance Plane:** The layer for policy and secrets management.
4.  **Monitoring and Logging Plane:** The hub for observability.
5.  **Resource Plane:** The underlying infrastructure where applications run.

Adopting a clear Reference Architecture is critical to preventing the platform from becoming a collection of misaligned or redundant tools. It forces discipline and focus, ensuring that every new capability contributes directly to a unified and effective platform. This deliberate, architecture-driven approach mitigates the risks of fragmentation and complexity that can dilute value, safeguarding the long-term integrity of the platform and the quality of the developer experience.

## 4. The Core Capability: The Platform Orchestrator

Within the **Integration and Delivery Plane** of our Reference Architecture, the single most critical new capability is the **Platform Orchestrator**. This is the engine that drives the self-service experience, and it is powered by the **Platform Solutions Automation (PSA)** solution.

The PSA works by creating a centralized coordination point for all platform teams. The core of the solution is a shared Git repository where each team defines its offerings (e.g., a database, a message queue) in a simple, structured JSON document. This document serves two purposes:

1.  It defines the questions that must be answered by a developer to request the service.
2.  It provides the technical instructions for how the request is automatically dispatched to the correct platform team's existing fulfillment systems.

The Platform Orchestrator consumes these JSON documents to generate a unified catalog of services within the developer portal. When a developer makes a request, the orchestrator uses the same information to route it for automated fulfillment. This creates a seamless, self-service experience for developers while allowing platform teams to maintain full ownership and control over their services.

For a detailed technical overview of this component, please refer to the *Platform Solutions Automation (PSA) Specification* document.

## 5. Recommendation

We confidently recommend the immediate adoption and implementation of the **Platform Solutions Automation (PSA)** solution, guided by the principles of our **Reference Architecture**.

This is the most effective and least disruptive path to modernizing our developer experience and accelerating innovation. By focusing on a lightweight orchestration layer that integrates with, rather than replaces, existing platform services, we can deliver significant value quickly. This approach empowers our developers, respects our organizational structure, and provides a scalable foundation for future platform enhancements. It is a decisive step, grounded in established principles, toward building a high-performing engineering organization.

## 6. Conclusion

The friction in our current developer experience is a direct impediment to our strategic goals. By embracing a progressive approach centered on Platform Solutions Automation and guided by a clear Reference Architecture, we can remove this friction. This strategy avoids the pitfalls of adding unnecessary complexity and instead focuses on a streamlined, value-driven design that prioritizes an efficient and empowering developer experience.

We can empower our teams, accelerate our delivery cycles, and create a culture of continuous innovation. This will be a key differentiator for our business for years to come.
