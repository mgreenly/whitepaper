*By Hannah Stone and Michael Greenly*

*Iteration 11*

## 1. Executive Summary

Our organization's ability to innovate is directly tied to the effectiveness of our internal developer platform. Currently, our developer experience is fragmented, characterized by manual, ticket-driven workflows that span multiple platform teams. This approach introduces significant friction, with application provisioning times often stretching from three to seven weeks, delaying the delivery of value. The long lead times and high cognitive load on our development teams represent a significant opportunity cost, hindering our ability to respond to market changes with agility.

This paper proposes a progressive, iterative strategy centered on **Platform Solutions Automation (PSA)**. As detailed in the *PSA Specification* document, this is a lightweight orchestration system that standardizes and automates infrastructure provisioning without requiring disruptive organizational changes. It leverages a centralized Git repository to manage a catalog of service offerings defined in simple YAML documents. This approach allows platform teams to maintain ownership of their services while contributing to a unified, automated, and transparent developer experience.

Our recommendation is to adopt the PSA model to create a connected, self-service platform. This will empower our internal "Dev Customers," reduce provisioning times, and enable a culture of continuous improvement and innovation. By focusing on the developer experience and providing clear, automated "golden paths," we can unlock significant productivity gains and accelerate our time-to-market.

## 2. The Challenge: A Fragmented Developer Experience

Our current internal platform has grown organically, resulting in a collection of powerful but disconnected capabilities. For our Dev Customers, navigating this landscape is a significant challenge. To provision a new application, a developer must interact with numerous platform teams through a series of JIRA tickets, a process that is both time-consuming and error-prone.

This fragmented approach leads to several critical issues:

*   **Long Provisioning Timelines:** The reliance on manual, ticket-based workflows across multiple teams results in an average provisioning time of **3-7 weeks**. This delay directly impacts our ability to deliver new features and services.
*   **High Cognitive Load:** Developers are forced to become experts in the organizational structure and specific processes of each platform team, from compute and storage to networking and messaging. This distracts them from their primary focus: building value-adding applications.
*   **Inconsistent Standards:** Without a unified approach, the application of standards and best practices is inconsistent, leading to operational risks and duplicated effort.
*   **Lost Opportunity:** Every week spent navigating internal processes is a week not spent on innovation. The current system creates a significant opportunity cost, limiting our capacity to experiment and respond to the needs of the business.

Previous attempts to address these challenges have focused on large-scale initiatives that have struggled to gain traction, particularly given our organization's operational constraints, such as the critical holiday code freeze period. A new approach is needed—one that is incremental, respects our current organizational structure, and delivers value quickly.

## 3. The Solution: Platform Solutions Automation (PSA)

We propose a more progressive and sustainable path forward: **Platform Solutions Automation (PSA)**. PSA is a lightweight, decentralized orchestration framework designed to create a unified and automated developer experience without requiring a disruptive overhaul of our existing teams or processes.

The core of PSA is a **Platform Solutions Catalog**, a shared Git repository containing a collection of YAML documents. Each document defines a specific service offering from a platform team, such as provisioning a database or a compute environment. These definitions serve a dual purpose:

1.  **For the Developer Portal:** They provide the necessary information to present a unified catalog of services to developers via our portal, "Stratus," complete with clear descriptions, required inputs, and cost estimates.
2.  **For the Orchestration System:** They contain the logic required to automatically dispatch a developer's request to the correct platform team's fulfillment process, whether that is an existing automation script or a JIRA ticket.

### Key Principles of the PSA Approach

*   **Iterative and Progressive:** PSA allows for gradual implementation. Platform teams can start by defining their services for manual JIRA-based fulfillment and introduce more advanced automation over time. This avoids the risks associated with large, all-or-nothing projects.
*   **Decentralized Ownership, Centralized Coordination:** Each platform team retains full ownership and control over its services and automation. The PSA catalog acts as a coordination point, not a central point of control, ensuring that expertise remains with the teams who know their domains best.
*   **Focus on the "Golden Path":** By codifying best practices into "platform solutions," we can guide developers toward proven, secure, and cost-effective architectural patterns, reducing decision fatigue and improving consistency.
*   **Transparency and Auditability:** Using a Git repository as the foundation for the service catalog provides a complete, auditable history of all changes, enhancing transparency and compliance.

## 4. Benefits of Adopting PSA

Implementing Platform Solutions Automation will yield significant benefits for our organization, directly addressing the challenges outlined above.

*   **Accelerated Time-to-Market:** By automating the provisioning process, we can drastically reduce the time it takes to get a new application environment from weeks to hours, or even minutes. This allows development teams to start building and delivering value faster.
*   **Increased Developer Productivity:** PSA abstracts away the complexity of our internal platform landscape. Developers can self-serve the resources they need through a simple, unified interface, freeing them to focus on writing code rather than navigating bureaucracy.
*   **Improved Reliability and Security:** By embedding standards and security controls into the automated "golden paths," we can ensure that all new applications are built on a foundation of best practices, reducing operational risk.
*   **Enhanced Cost Visibility and Governance:** The PSA model integrates cost estimation directly into the service request process. This provides developers with immediate feedback on the financial impact of their decisions and enables better cost governance across the organization.
*   **Sustainable Scalability:** The decentralized nature of PSA allows our platform to scale without creating a central bottleneck. As new platform teams and services emerge, they can easily be integrated into the catalog, fostering a culture of continuous improvement.

## 5. A Phased Implementation Strategy

We recommend a phased approach to implementing PSA, ensuring that we deliver value at each stage and adapt based on feedback from our Dev Customers.

*   **Phase 1: Establish the Catalog and Manual Fulfillment:**
    *   Establish the central Git repository for the Platform Solutions Catalog.
    *   Work with the core platform teams (Compute, Storage, Networking) to define their initial service offerings in the YAML format, as specified in the PSA documentation.
    *   Integrate the catalog with the "Stratus" developer portal to provide a unified view of available services.
    *   All requests will initially be fulfilled via the existing JIRA ticket process, but initiated through the new, standardized interface.

*   **Phase 2: Introduce Automation and Cost Visibility:**
    *   Begin automating the fulfillment of the most frequently requested and easily automated services.
    *   Integrate cost estimation data into the service definitions to provide developers with upfront cost visibility.
    *   Measure the reduction in provisioning time for automated services.

*   **Phase 3: Expand and Iterate:**
    *   Onboard additional platform teams to the PSA catalog.
    *   Introduce the concept of "bundles"—collections of services that represent a complete application stack (e.g., a standard microservice).
    *   Gather feedback from development teams to continuously improve the service offerings and the overall developer experience.

## 6. Conclusion

The current friction in our developer experience is a significant impediment to our organization's agility and innovation. The path to improvement does not lie in another large, disruptive initiative, but in a pragmatic, iterative approach that empowers our teams and respects our operational realities.

**Platform Solutions Automation (PSA)** offers such a path. By creating a unified, automated, and self-service platform, we can remove the bottlenecks that slow us down, reduce the cognitive load on our developers, and foster a culture of speed and innovation. This is not about buying a new tool; it is about connecting our existing capabilities into a cohesive and efficient system.

Adopting the PSA strategy is a direct investment in our development teams and, by extension, in our ability to deliver value to our customers. It is a crucial step toward building a truly modern and effective internal developer platform that will serve as a strategic enabler for the entire organization. We recommend moving forward with the phased implementation plan to begin realizing these benefits as quickly as possible.
