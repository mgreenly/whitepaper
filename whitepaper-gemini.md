## 1. Executive Summary

In today's competitive landscape, the speed at which we can deliver new applications and services is a critical driver of business success. However, our current internal processes for application provisioning are creating significant friction, with development teams often waiting 3-7 weeks to get the resources they need. This delay directly translates to lost opportunity and a diminished capacity for innovation.

This paper proposes a strategic shift in our approach. We recommend the adoption of a **Platform Solutions Automation (PSA)** capability, guided by a well-defined **Reference Architecture**. This approach will empower our development teams with a modern, self-service developer portal, drastically reducing application provisioning times and enabling us to build and iterate at the pace our business demands. This is not a proposal for a disruptive overhaul, but a progressive, value-driven strategy that works within our existing organizational structure to unlock the full potential of our engineering talent.

## 2. The Challenge: A Fragmented Developer Experience

Our current developer experience is characterized by fragmentation and manual handoffs. To provision a new application, a development team must navigate a complex process of submitting multiple JIRA tickets to various platform teams, including compute, storage, messaging, and networking. This multi-team dependency chain is the primary contributor to the 3-7 week lead time for new projects.

This lengthy cycle creates a significant drag on innovation. Furthermore, our organization's operational calendar, which includes a critical code freeze between August and February to protect holiday season stability, makes large-scale, disruptive technology initiatives impractical. Past attempts at sweeping modernization have struggled against these realities. The path forward must respect these constraints, focusing on incremental value delivery that aligns with, rather than disrupts, our core business rhythms.

## 3. A Foundational Framework: The Reference Architecture

To ensure a coherent and sustainable evolution of our developer platform, we must ground our efforts in a formal **Reference Architecture**. This architecture provides an opinionated, best-practice framework for our Internal Developer Platform (IDP), defining its core components and how they interact.

Adopting a clear Reference Architecture is critical to preventing the platform from becoming a collection of misaligned or redundant tools. It forces discipline and focus, ensuring that every new capability, including the Platform Orchestrator, contributes directly to a unified, streamlined, and effective platform. This deliberate, architecture-driven approach mitigates the risk of fragmentation and complexity, safeguarding the long-term value and integrity of the platform.

## 4. The Core Capability: The Platform Orchestrator

Within the "Integration and Delivery Plane" of our Reference Architecture, the single most critical new capability is the **Platform Orchestrator**. This is the engine that drives the self-service experience, and it is powered by the **Platform Solutions Automation (PSA)** solution.

The PSA works by creating a centralized coordination point for all platform teams. The core of the solution is a Git repository where each team defines its offerings (e.g., a database, a message queue) in a simple JSON document. This document serves two purposes:

1.  It defines the questions that must be answered by a developer to request the service.
2.  It provides the technical instructions for how the request is automatically dispatched to the correct platform team's existing fulfillment systems.

The Platform Orchestrator consumes these JSON documents to generate a unified catalog of services within the developer portal. When a developer makes a request, the orchestrator uses the same information to route it for automated fulfillment. This creates a seamless, self-service experience for developers while allowing platform teams to maintain full ownership and control over their services.

For a detailed technical overview of the Platform Solutions Automation, please refer to the *PSA Specification* document.

## 5. Recommendation

We confidently recommend the immediate adoption and implementation of the **Platform Solutions Automation (PSA)** solution, as defined by the principles of our **Reference Architecture**.

This is the most effective and least disruptive path to modernizing our developer experience and accelerating innovation. By focusing on a lightweight orchestration layer that integrates with, rather than replaces, existing platform services, we can deliver significant value quickly. This approach empowers our developers, respects our organizational structure, and provides a scalable foundation for future platform enhancements.

## 6. Conclusion

The current friction in our developer experience is a direct impediment to our strategic goals. By embracing a progressive approach centered on Platform Solutions Automation and guided by a clear Reference Architecture, we can remove this friction. We can empower our teams, accelerate our delivery cycles, and create a culture of continuous innovation that will be a key differentiator for our business for years to come.
